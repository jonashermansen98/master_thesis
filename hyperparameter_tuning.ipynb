         "['Hi! Today started great but the few times I’ve run into issues it’s always been at McDonald’s, which I would like to address in this message, because it affects not only me but other couriers and customers also. First of all I always respect each vendors’ instructions such as always bringing my bag into the venue etc. and if you look at McDonald’s instructions it says: 1. Show the order on your phone to the staff 2. Swipe order as picked-up 3. Get the bag with the food Sometimes they get angry if you don’t follow this but I don’t think it makes sense why only McDonald’s have these special instructions when no other vendor does? Today when I walked in the order #980 was already at -27 minutes and I showed it to the staff, at 13.16 I swiped right according to the instructions because I thought it was ready and did the same thing with the other two tasks #985 and #986, which were handed to me immediately but upon further waiting the staff told me that #980 had been “lost in their system” and that they would need to remake it and it would be done in “maybe 15 minutes” and that I should write to Wolt to remove the order. At 13.27 I write to Wolt to explain the situation asking if I should wait or remove. Wolt support asked me to wait for pickup. So I waited a little longer and then asked the staff whether I should wait for the order but he simply told me “We are very busy, somebody else will pick up that order” so at 13.34 I write to support again and ask for a removal even though I wanted to wait for pickup. At 13.40 wolt support removed the order and I leave McDonald’s after almost 30 minutes of being there to continue my deliveries. Then at 14.11, almost one hour after I first received order #980, I get the exact same order #980 from McDonald’s to the same customer, and pick it up. Of course I wondered why nobody else had picked it up earlier but maybe it wasn’t ready until I came, I don’t know, but when I arrived to the customer I saw she was very upset, which is understandable so after giving her the food I tried to explain kindly that McDonalds had to make the order twice but it didn’t help she just slammed the door before I could finish my sentence. We are all human and make mistakes but in this case McDonalds had 27 minutes to take care of this “lost order” either by contacting Wolt directly or informing me as a courier before swiping. I learned my lesson and will never again swipe unless the order is given to me, no matter how angry staff gets because I don’t want to go through this kind of inconvenience I went through today because it feels really bad for me to contact Wolt support about issues such as these. Wolt support was of course amazing and kind towards me but I hope that McDonald’s will change these special instructions and that someone will think of an idea to make the pick-up experience at McDonalds as smooth and as professional as in other venues. Thank you for taking your time to read this! David', \"I had an unacceptable experience at McDonald's, i arrive and the order should've been ready 5 minutes ago, i wait at the Wolt pickup line for about 10 minutes, before I get impatient and say excuse me before I ask for someone if my order is being prepared. Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\", 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”']"

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

Began as courier 5 months ago (it may well be described as relatively new), but today\\'s \"experience\" then gives rise to high blood pressure… I write in in the afternoon (at 16 o\\'clock I think) because I can see in the Wolt App where customers order that they are closed and/or only the possibility of pickup. I ask in the Partner app why there is closed, etc. “There can be many reasons” I am told .. After 20 min. Is the recommendation that I should shut down the app, restart my phone and open the app again. It didn\\'t help. Then she finds out that the city is not open to deliveries .. 25 min. Should it go from I approached ... whether she was able to open it again, or if she got help, I have no idea, but open it was ... but only for a short while. So \"closed\" the city again for delivery .. I have never, until today, experienced this \"phenomenon\" that just shuts down for deliveries. And I wondered when, after all, I was online and drove .. So big is Thisted and the surrounding area, after all .. I did not contact myself again and again got hold of one in the partner support that, like most of the others, must not / can / will inform anything. Whether they had tried to send push messages out to the other couriers, etc. \"Unfortunately, I must not disclose that\" .. What for something ?? Is it so secret that your internal guidelines mean that I, as an active courier, must not know such information? As I wrote in the Partner Support, I wouldn\\'t \"waste\" my time being online if the city is shut down anyway? For how long would go? Would it open again, etc.? No help to pick up .. But I was welcome to call the courier .. I tried it so .. got hold of an English speaker .. who tried to quiet. No one took the phone. The English speaker tried again. No one took the phone. He tried again. I finally came through to a Danish -speaking support that thought it was \"wild\" that her from the partner support had pointed out that I could call in. Since they have no more information on the courier line than they have in the partner support .. Asked him a few questions on the phone and the response was something in the direction of \"now I have to take care I don\\'t tell too much\" .. So .. why all the secret? Why not be open and tell how the situation is. Then I also have a better opportunity to assess whether I should stay online (as well as hold and wait too long for you to press a button that allows people to order food for delivery again) .. It is difficult sometimes to see your act. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to get in touch with a person who can and will help .. The only time I really feel there is help to pick up is if I get an order that I would like to get rid of, as it is far from ready, while I may have a few other orders to lie in the car in the heat/cool the bags .. pretty much everything else does not matter. It\\'s a gossip for a gossip. \"I can\\'t disclose that,\" \"I must not tell,\" \"Our internal guidelines mean that I cannot get closer to this\" .. Amen, it is crazy sometimes .. And no matter how incredible it sounds, I am actually happy to run food out like Wolt Kurer. I am passionate about good service. I am passionate about making people happy and satisfied. But I really miss being greeted right away with the people I turn to to get help. Incidentally, I still miss the answer from both the HR department and the “OPS Team” .. Yes, there are cases .. Yes, there are more from the Partner Support who either move for answers or even created new cases as it should increase the chance of a feedback / response. Why should one case not be enough?', 'Haven’t got my first order yet otherwise app worked well', 'Couldn’t deliver the orders because of App']"

         "[\"I am charged with some of 90 kroner for a restaurant that has a little boy behind the box that does not hear the difference from orders 896 and 892. It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", \"I had the order 7J5DV3, in which the app sent me to a different adress 1km away and that was not from the client, i sent a message to support to tell about it and the person I have talked to told me that the point from the app was right, which was not, i sent pictures of it, but she was insisting that i was wrong, also she told me that i had to deliver to the customer without compensation because i was only 20 meters away from the adress, when i was 1km away, also sent pictures, but didn't believe me neither, she told me to tell her once i deliver the order, so after i delived the order, i told her, but couldn't mark it as delivered, so i had to contact to support again about that, it's been a long time wasted, which means money, cold food and unhappy customers\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

Even if they make an order for the first time, they don't give it to us until they get a response for double pay from wolt. I got an order today. It was marked ready. 3 minutes late. I asked them where the food is. They asked me to wait 5 minutes to make it, but they never make it in 5 minutes. I removed the order. One of my friends received the same order after 7 minutes.

      "3. If it is quiet and there is no orders for everyone you should give bundles to others couriers. It is selfish and unfair\n",
      "4. Today was a rather difficult day. I took 2 rather heavy bundle orders from the Wolt Market which I had to carry in my backpack. The first order was delivered which I received Dkr 60, but my second order which was equally heavy and 300 meters from the first order and I was only paid Dkr 30. I carried that heavy load 1.6km on my back and I was only paid 30 for carrying 300 meters. I understand there's a new bundle payment system. I can understand getting an extra 30 for carrying another McDonald's order 300 meters farther than the first order. But a heavy wolt market shopping list. You need to look over the bundle payment agreement. There's something seriously wrong there. Until the bundle payment is correctly adjusted, I think I'll avoid it cause personally, it feels like we are being taken advantage off. And I had a cancelled order by McDonald's at Kongens Nytorv. I arrived and they said my order was being made. I waited 30 minutes and they cancelled my order saying it was too busy. I was only compensated 30 for waiting 30 minutes through no fault of mine or Wolts. Compensation agreement should also be reviewed. Other than that. The app was working great and the Wolt support team was amazing. Especially Elena who helped me out.\n",
      "5. The new bundle system needs you to shape way up in the restaurants delays, because otherwise it’s a useless new feature!!! Or add more info on minutes! Plus ready orders should also have minutes added!\n",
      "6. Totally messed up. Orders super delayed.. The algorithm sending totally opposite way for bundles because it was crazy delayed everywhere so, one task at a time because of this and also because the bundles are payed totally unfair, 25, 23, 22kr for a bundle... Have you asked yourself why is it like this? Nobody wants to go in the rain for 30kr for a task... It's even summer.. Have you planned winter??? There's gonna be a huge problem as I see. Get back to old payment method\n",

      "8. Still hope bundles, especially the heavy ones, will be rewarded better. Hope you share some of your profits with the couriers..\n",
      "9. Too much emphasis on bundles. Instead of having single orders delivered on time there are bundles with late drop offs. This needs to be fixed, reverted to the older system!!!\n",

What distance show in the app also doesn’t match with the real road map. This is injustice. You are making money out of US. 2. For long distance order we are not paid sufficiently. According to the single order you are giving ideal amount but while we take long distance order you pay a very poor amount that is truly injustice but you are receiving full delivery charge from the customer and paying your hero’s less. 3. For multiple order you are adding additional amount for the rider but taking full amount from the customer is high was not seen before in wolt. Many of the rider are furious about this changes.

Payment should be provided accordingly to the pickup to delivery distance for individual order not like additional distance and you take the full amount paying us on for additional ride. 4.

They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'I am very dissatisfied with restaurants. Restaurants mark the food as ready, after arriving at the restaurant the food is not ready and I wait 5-10 minutes until they prepare the food.

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

Pack it so that the bags cannot go and do not overfill the bags. Rather use a bag more or a plastic bag more, please!\"]"

Which is some hell of a swine, personally I reject all orders for less than 40,- That is, even one of 39.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out and made up to 3 times I have experienced, as us cures who are left can not reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results. Give and it comes back, stingy and you get smack. !!']"

Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\", 'I am very dissatisfied with restaurants.

You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"If you can't ask MENU not to pack milk/milk cartons (and other cartons or packaging with sharp edges) in paper bags, at least not with a lot of other heavy items, as the edges of the milk cartons cut holes in the paper bags when lifting the bags and the contents move and put pressure on the sides. Pack it so that the bags cannot go and do not overfill the bags. Rather use a bag more or a plastic bag more, please!\"]"

      "4. I couldn't reach the customer for 20 minutes and delivered it to her boyfriend. Again a problem at rush hour. That's too bad.\n",
      "5. I took an order from a place, and when I arrived, they told me that the order was to pick in an hour from that time. If wolt allowes to the people to order on a specific time, they should write somewhere in the task so the courier can know and reject it if it’s not useful, or they should send the task to the courier when is going to be ready, not one hour before, because I lost time going to the venue and also I got no compensation for it. For that time wolt support was really slow and took 15 minutes to unassign the task. Really disappointed today\n",

      "15. The application completed a task without me being close to the address, it must be a bug in the system or something. Please check how could this be possible. It caused a delay for the customer to receive the food, and if the support person does not contact me I would have not been able to deliver the task.\n",

      "2. Would be nice to get compensated for when restaurants are late. Burger Concept is constantly late 15-20 minutes, so no one wants to accept orders from there. Couriers are just wasting time\n",
      "3. Once you have taken an order and it is ready at 6pm and you know in advance you come 10 min late, then it is not smart that you can only report 10min delayed when the food is already ready. You must have a function where you can report delayed immediately so that the arrival and the end time of the food fit and it is picked up warm.\n",
      "4. Mc Donald’s frederiksberg just make us to wait there outside even if food is ready and available.\n",
      "5. It makes no sense to collect two orders where the first is ice cream, after which you have to wait +10 minutes on another order to come. Get the timing control!\n",
      "6. Have experienced several times now that Burger King is extremely slow and disorganized. It takes too long for them to make the order ready, even small and simple orders have been extremely delayed.\n",
      "7. Berlin Döner on Nørrebrogade Marker Ordering as ready and when I come in and have to take it then she says they have started right now. I thought it is totally bad and disrespect where I have to wait 10min to order even though on the app this is ready. I have experienced from them several times the same mistake and thought it is not going.\n",

      "12. Sivas pizza marked the orders ready even if it is not ready yet!\n",
      "13. Orders coming too far, fees too low The order seems ready, but when I come to the restaurant, it is not ready. I am given 5-6 minutes. Can you contact the restaurants so that they do not mark the orders as ready if they are not ready? Distance charges are decreasing day by da\n",
      "14. McDonald's in Frederiksberg wasted not only my time, but other drivers time. They weren't that busy, I saw t least 5 personal there just standing around and having fun with each other, they didn't respond with I tried getting their attention, which is why I cancelled the order (and declined the two subsequent orders that came) - resulting in me having an extremely slow hour between 22.00 and 23.00. A competing delivery service driver told me I was the third to cancel the order and leave, because the workers at this McDonald's apparently weren't working very fast (if at all)\n",

      "13. In general, the support seems to be extremely helpful and quick to return. Today, however, I had a tremendously unfortunate experience that was the mix of pure accidents and slow support. The order I was going to pick up (which was marked ready), there was someone who had snapped, and so I contacted the support. At first I was distributed and then I was asked whether I will wait for a remake or not (this went okay strong). To this, I replied that probably had to wait for the remake. It went over 10 minutes before the support started the remake. This meant I spent over 20 minutes on McDonald's on an order already marked ready. I had probably expected some kind of compensation, which I have received for much less things in the past. So all in all super sorry situation :(.\n",

I show them the order on my phone. They show me the order on their tablet, saying the order is 2 6 9.... I say mine is 2 6 8. They don't understand why 2 6 8 is my order, and not 2 6 9...

I even think about to invest in a e bike this month to be more efficient ;) Please just remind the restaurant (Pizza Top) please to pack the food in a extra paper bag, cause it is not hygienic to transport Pommes in a Styrofoam bag, where the ketchup or mayonnaise can run out and the couriers have to clean than the bag again and again - which takes a lot of time. It would also look better for the customer to get the food in a paper bag.\n",
      "2. hello It is necessary to say two things here. 1- On rainy and cold days and after sunset the stated prices for delivery do not differ from hot summer days, which is very problematic considering that under heavy rain, the delivery work is really difficult, especially with a motorcycle that is directly exposed to the rain and we spray water from the side of the cars, it will be very difficult so we have to reject some orders. 2- Burger King Vanløse has a problem with the beverage package, and almost all orders including the drinks have waste or leaks that need to be warned because it is us who are questioned when the food is delivered.\n",

McDonald's, on the other hand, packs their food well in large bags, however, they put very little in the big bags, so you end up with 3 large bags for an order. Since I have to pick up three orders at once away, they can't be in my bag at once.\n",

      "11. Some bend, I should ask for bags for the orders. When the customer pays for it, they must also give one.\n",
      "12. I recommend that you include ‘fragile’ category marked with a sticker or marker pen to each order that contains anything fragile, ranging from eggs through fruits and liquids like drinks in plastic cups and soups to improve awareness, safety of a delivery, and overall quality and satisfaction of a customer and partner rating. Especially in the Wolt Market where products can be damaged easily. Some venues inform me about such contents but some don’t and it is not alright because I most often I don’t see the contents through the bag and I cannot ensure the quality of delivered. That way I would be able to take double the care about such orders. Moreover, the design of bags should have some straps inside to secure bags from moving that happens a lot when riding over cobblestone roads and uneven surfaces and turns. Again, improving safety standards of goods delivered.\n",

Hi, I bealive that there should be possibility to check where the order will be delivered and to check how bug the order is in termes of itemy and size so partner can imagine how bug the order is and He/she knows if it can be fit inside the bag when there are multiplex orders. Other than that it is Great\n",
      "14. Carls JR gives drinking products without the bag, how is it possible to deliver it without anything happening to it unless you hold in hand\n",
      "15. McDonald’s City slower to pack orders with the new bag system, bags take up more space.\n",
      "16. Some fast food joints should start packing drinks better, it’s not a big issue, but the drinks are dripping, and the acid from the soda damages the bag, which we have to pay ourselves. Also, customers might think the drink is spilled if they see some drops running down the cups. Burger King, Carl Jr’s and a few other ones. In other countries a layer of plastic is put on the drinks. Also. It’s been pretty quiet. Please don’t hire too many couriers.\n",
      "17. The bags in the Wolt Supermarket were crowded. All the bags couldn't be in the bag despite pressing as much as possible in it. The last bag broke under the weight and the contents which were many small soda bottles overturned over Nørrebrogade. It's too stupid not to think about how much there can be in the bag when you have shared one out and know how much space everyone has. Put a Limit on item or give the big orders to people in cars if needed\n",
      "18. Burger king has to stop giving drinks in cups. They spill every time, and the canned drinks stay cool much better!!\n",
      "19. A comment for Wok in Vesterbro. I delivered two orders and the bags both broke due to leaking packing. 1st orders bag broke directly as I handed to the customer, the second i had to arrange the mess into something deliverable. I would advise they look at their packaging to make it less leaky as the deliverable product doesn’t look pretty for me or the customer.\n",

      "3. With this new bundle system, you took the chance to get any tips. The food will be cold and it will take more time to deliver. More unsatisfied customers.. less will order in the long run... for example, I am getting comments like .. what took u so long.. and did you find the way finally?ect...and I did as fast i could.. and I think as fast as possible with a car. It's stressing, and I am not used to meeting unhappy and angry customers\n",

But when I marked the order as picked up, I was offered a bundle/new order at Sushi Lovers in Torvehallerne. The order was to be delivered Nørregade 40.

Police had closed bridges and made barriers so that traffic was totally impassable. I am surprised that you have no monitoring on, so you can prevent cars from getting trips to areas where traffic is totally quiet due to an accident. The restaurants elsewhere in the city wondered that they were not serviced faster, but it is clear if a lot of Wolt is curing by car is stuck in the inner city because the app has lured them to take a trip in there.\n",

The algorythm for that calculations made failures. 2- i'm experimenting 6~10 times/hour hard lagging in app, aprox. 30 sec you can't mark the items from an order and you can't swap the button for picking up; or you push the button but the google map is not starting, for driving toward to customer.

I dont know what happened, but since beginning of february (after big freezing days) it feels like you hired 2x more couriers than needed and now I literally drive in the city center near the lakes in peak hours (17-19:30) on friday / saturday and I see area demand: Normal.... and whole day till 17:00 its Quiet... and for 5-10mins I have no order (which before i had like 3 orders pre minute) 2. Im getting those annoying and not true push notifications (which arent even messages i can respond to) saying that \"We missed you on friday and saturday so go and earn today\" .. i was literally working (freezing outside waiting 5mins for order) both days so why am I receiving these fake untrue messages and why are you trying to motivate me to go to work when then im freezing and feeling like you dont have work for me? 3. I was checking on AppStore app updates messages and your developers use just general text \"we are working hard on improving the app..\", but I dont see or feel any improvement, all things which annoy me from begining of using the app are still there, literally nothing changed.. there is many things which could be improved or added/removed which would make our lives easier.. in app feedback after finishing the shift I already wrote about it and that im former programmer and ux designer and that i could give more detailed feedback but it was ignored .. PS now in this freezing/windy/rainy weather its very hard to work and earn enough money to survive the month in general and with that change which happened since beginning of this february I no longer feel this work will secure me to survive the next months when I literally can work only between 17 and 19:45 cos whole day is quiet and no orders at all, and in peak hours we barely have enough orders ..but thats not enough to sirvive from it.. if i spend 20-30min in restaurant sometimes cos they are busy or dont have som ingredients, its literally 20% of whole my \"productive workday\" time when i can work and it hurts my earnings so much and I cant avoid it to happen time to time cos they say \"it will be in few minutes..\" so i wait and wait and when i ask they say ye its getting ready.. and usually they dont admit its their fault.. etc.. Simply: I wana go at 11, 13, 15, 16 and have enough orders to work for 4-8hours a day and earn enough money as in regular job again. :( Im guessing you probably hired too many people cos when was very freezing nobody wanted to work, but now is the problem that we go work and have not enough orders.. so please fix it somehow, ..and please stop sending those untrue push notifications saying that you missed me previous days when I literally was driving and freezing in city centre during weekend and peek hours and had to wait 5mins for the order ... Thanks and wish you to have a beautiful day :)\n",

Just seemed too poor that you can't make that system in case of such a thing that someone else comes and takes over, so I chose to pay $ 175 alone for the customer's sake, so he would get fresh food and stopped and drove home with a deficit instead\n",

      "4. Hi Wolt I write as I notice that an order ordered at Wolt has not been delivered or picked up by a courier when you have returned to the Rasstuan. My idea with the problem as a solution is to get the tasks popped up after. 2-3 minutes again if the food has not been picked up by another curl. We find that we received a task from Burger King at 3 o'clock at night approx. We drive out to Burger King and Burger King was closed at the time. An addition to the app could be smart if you have more orders on the trip that you can sort who you first run out to the direction on the road. (Unless it's hot food so it's first priority) I was thinking about whether you could raise delivery the price a little? For example, to drive about 15 minutes away and get approx. 80 kr but nothing to drive back to the next task Hope my message made sense if not then ask finally\n",

Then he ended our conversation abruptly. I think it’s unprofessional and rude. If this is how he was trained, it also shows me that Wolt only cares about customers but not couriers. It’s not about the distance, but the hassle, the time wasted, the countless confusing and confused phone calls and messages, the effort and stress, the apology I had to give to the other customer who’s food I had in the car and I was very late with.

At the reception they reject me because the address was different and they don t have a name of the customer. I call the customer but they didn t answer me. I was outside with 2 packages, their one was like 10kg and started to rain, heavy rain... and i put the package inside the box again. I contacted the support but with all the water and the time i lose 40 minutes. Later the support give me a correct number, a third one. And they confirm that the hotel was correct. So I lose time, energy and make problems with 2 deliveries. I just want to ask you to do two things. Make a blacklist and check the number of the customers or force them to put the name of the hotel and the relative name of the booking in that hotel. So if the customer is from an hotel I can easily pass the reception with correct data. And the customer after 3 hours, while I was sleeping they call me. So i would like to propose a black list for the hotel and these couple of customers. The hotel was Axel guldsmeden hotels, they have 2 address front and back door. They weren t collaborative. Even if I show them the address of the backdoor they insist that the name of the customer was the hotel, another place. Secondly the customer, i don t care if they were tired or lazy, they used the wrong name in the hotel, they didn t give me the name pf the hotel, they give me the backdoor, the phone was wrong. And they call me during the night. I SPENT 1 hour in the night, under rain for some banana and idk. So please make a black list or make a procedure to force the customer to don t be retarded. Next time I will spend 10 or 15 minuts after this I will consider lose the delivery. No one pay me if I get sick or If the customer don t answer. I am trying to be professional but I don t like to lose my energy and time. So I repeat put the hotel on a black list because they werent collaborative. If they were more open I can save 20 minutes and avoid to stay under a heavy rain with an heavy bag.\n",

It seemed as if the customer's name was set in, but the address pointed to where I had to pick up an order for Ciao Pasta. It also seemed mysterious that I had to pick up an order with Homeburger, which was my collection # 2, even though the customer was on the way to Homeburger - why not deliver to this customer first, and then make the next 2 collections, which were right next to each other, and then deliver to the last 2 customers? The support was also not for much help in this situation, and it took too long to move forward.

Generally I cannot always, as a courier, check the food, because often times it’s placed in a sealed food bag by the restaurant. So out of respect for the customers, I don’t break the seal to check what’s inside. So I have to trust the restaurant staff when receiving an order. I would recommend Wolt to make the restaurants either always tape the receipt of the food content on the bags or hand the receipt over to the courier to be sure the food is correct. There are many young service employees in this area who works in restaurants, and they are not always that observant and precise with the orders.

This last time the venue itself canceled by mistake (they wanted the reject a later order that they couldn't make in time and not my order that they have made already). The first time I don't know who canceled it (venue or customer). The point is when this happend you cannot just take the task away without some sort of notification (possibly with sound too or something). What if I biked 15 or 20 minutes all the way to the venue for nothing? I understand the customer or venue can decide to reject the task but the courier needs to be notified right away. The app right now basically just goes back to \"waiting for tasks\" silently with the courier still thinking that he's biking/driving to pick up a task. What makes it even worse is that when I contacted support they \"don't know what I'm talking about cause they cannot see I took any task\". The app needs to be amended.

While it was a bundle, I find the price too low: the customer had asked to have the order delivered to the 5th floor… apparently there is an elevator in the building, but one needs a special card to ride the elevator..So as it is a tall building, getting to the fifth floor, is quite hard.. if all the students/customers start asking for 5th floor delivery for that price, I will stay away from those orders..\n",
      "2. Why I can't reject the order?\n",

      "4. Better pay for donkey orders: I was dumb enough to accept a task from a supermarket. The order distance was short, the pay was low, but the order was heavy and had to be delivered to the fifth floor no elevator. I feel such orders should pay better. What do you think? Have you ever tried carrying a heavy bag of groceries to the fifth floor?\n",

      "8. Two things Some venues keep forgetting the extra soda. Also, when I want to stop working I have to hear that annoying ringing sound and wait 60 seconds. When those seconds are over I tried to go offline, but I immediately got another task. (In bundle )\n",
      "9. It would be really cool if it could be made so you could see if you were on a bundle order and had to pick up two orders from the same store, because it would be much easier for everyone if you could say to the staff from the beginning of May to pick up two, rather than getting the first one, packing it, and then having to grab the staff again to get the next order\n",

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"If you can't ask MENU not to pack milk/milk cartons (and other cartons or packaging with sharp edges) in paper bags, at least not with a lot of other heavy items, as the edges of the milk cartons cut holes in the paper bags when lifting the bags and the contents move and put pressure on the sides. Pack it so that the bags cannot go and do not overfill the bags. Rather use a bag more or a plastic bag more, please!\"]"

Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\", 'I am very dissatisfied with restaurants.

Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"If you can't ask MENU not to pack milk/milk cartons (and other cartons or packaging with sharp edges) in paper bags, at least not with a lot of other heavy items, as the edges of the milk cartons cut holes in the paper bags when lifting the bags and the contents move and put pressure on the sides. Pack it so that the bags cannot go and do not overfill the bags. Rather use a bag more or a plastic bag more, please!\"]"

      "1. Im happy but im not a fan when i get a High value order (above 60kr)and i accept it and then it disappears and is replaced with a low value order (below 30kr)\n",
      "2. Same bs: You have programmed the algorithm to wait with offering tasks until one is around 500 meter away from the venue, probably only when order level is quiet/order is not too late…\n",
      "3. No tasks being sent through. Then taking offline as I wasn’t accepting tasks. Something wrong with app today.\n",
      "4. Will the app not come soon in Apple CarPlay\n",
      "5. Hello with you \"Wolt\" You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you have set our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing of 450 meters when the reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells you that you have listened to us where we used to get payment per piece for full distance. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km, can give 24,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Personally I reject all order to less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected PS. I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped. It will probably not last long until I do the same\n",
      "6. I was not paid the promised compensation?\n",
      "7. I work on a bike, pizza up to 32 cm in my bag, but from Express pizza I often get orders with larger pizzas that do not fit into my backpack.\n",
      "8. When the customer has chosen contact-free delivery, it says in app that I need to wait until the customer opens the door, but some customers don't know that the courier needs to wait for them to open the door, so sometimes (not so often though) it takes a long time for that to happen. Maybe it could be made clearer to the customers?\n",
      "9. Time estimates were way off sometimes\n",
      "10. Many of us are upset about the incentive they give to inactive accounts. They are motivated to give them an extra 500dkk for making 40 orders in a week, when we were motivated with a bonus of half that amount for making 50 orders in 2 and a half days. I think they are handling this situation in the wrong way. Motivate the riders who dedicate their time full time to Wolt and you will see the results.\n",
      "11. It was really awful, the performance of the program and the distribution of orders. I was active for more than 10 hours today, and I moved to many places in the city center and order centers, but I got the least amount of orders.\n",
      "12. Seems it takes too long before you get your salary paid. Still wonders me about how -sdor The WoltApe turns down for what you hear from the phone. This means that you have to restart the app every time you have been given a task.\n",
      "13. The app doesn't seem to work when I swipe it.\n",
      "14. Lolo vu7vu77.æmo9 Jjjj5nnujb4brm\n",
      "15. Seems several of the orders were low paid if you take conditions for where the weather has been. Voting rights to drive around than yesterday. And distance from venue to the customer seems not to have worked? Or succeeded all and the day has been good\n",
      "16. How is it possible to accept an order, see details about it, go to pick it up and on the way it simply disappears from the screen? This is unacceptable\n",
      "17. That fat. Just a job for me\n",
      "18. Brakes, utilization, 40 to 100 kr per hour.\n",
      "19. Still no notification when the food is rready on iOS iPhone 14 Pro Max\n",

      "2. Please pay out on time, it’s very unpredictable when I’m gonna get my money that I worked for.\n",
      "3. When I heard we got pay from a-b-c am really happy, but when I was dilevered order I was shock the price more worst than before! very unsatisfied like there is no more future in wolt job\n",
      "4. 3 HOURS WAITING WITHOUT ORDER. W T F WOLT ???\n",
      "5. The information for the bonus was from 11:00 am to 1:30 pm, and I got the notification at 3:30 pm.\n",
      "6. few orders. long waiting times. on a friday evening. is wolt coming back to normal?\n",
      "7. Hi, I dont know why i am getting less deliveries. When i see other people doing wolt, they have much deliveries.\n",
      "8. Really happy about everything related to Wolt and most partners. However there is a general problem with some of the larger and smaller restaurants pushing the “order is ready”, while in reality we end up waiting 5-15 minutes for the order. Especially Hubbs Kitchen, both Frederiksberg and Nordvestare some of the biggest ones in this. As couriers we miss out reaching boost goals, when we are kept waiting, two Hubbs orders can destroy the tarvet of reaching 12 orders before 20.00.\n",
      "9. Good, the pay could be a bit higher though\n",
      "10. I am happy with wolt but not with restaurant.. few restaurant like o snacks Frederiksberg, they will just make us to wait for long after marking food as ready\n",
      "11. 8 hours 870 with bonus. Wolt is not worth any more.\n",
      "12. Time estimates and the average salary on weekdays are not 170 kr. (At least not close to in slice outside peak hours and even many times in peak hours)\n",
      "13. There is not enough work what we have to make money\n",
      "14. There are very few orders.\n",
      "15. À big shame on … by making this worthless decision about the printing model . You’re abusing us\n",

      "17. Waiting time for new order more than one hour is not good in my opinion and my colleagues after 10 minutes sitting next to me has\n",

      "1. Problems with spar and mcd Valby\n",
      "2. Not nice to ride all the way to a restaurant, to pick up an order in “ready” status just to get the message that it will take 10+min before it’s ready… in that case you should put a charge on the venue and compensate the rider…\n",
      "3. There’s always problems with McDonalds they marked the orders like ready but almost every time I have to wait 10 or 15 minutes until I get my order\n",
      "4. There is often a long wait for McDonald's. Both because they are delayed, but also sometimes because they just are not aware of us Bude coming in and orders that are ready. So you almost have to shout them up for them to find that there is one to take the order that is ready.\n",
      "5. A trouble waited over 40 min because “café tidlōs” gave the order to Just Eat\n",
      "6. Have had problems today and yesterday that I came out to the restaurant where it was -10 min, but the order was not ready, it was not in the system. So the restaurant should see the order on my phone and then make it first .. It's a little tricky to waste time and lose other orders on\n",
      "7. I used to decline orders from mc Donald’s. They treat Wolt employees very disrespectful. This happened again for me to night. I’m not going to take orders from Mc Donald’s anymore until they begin to respect me.\n",
      "8. Long time delay for orders at Golden Burger\n",
      "9. I don't have problems with the patnership, everything is going ok. My only problem is that some restaurants take to much time with the orders or they put it ready but it's not. If that issue could be improved, it will be perfect\n",
      "10. Symphony and Berlin Döner have the orders standing as ready for pickup but when you arrive they must first start on them. I can understand that they are in a hurry and therefore give the customers who are food, but the customers who order online are also waiting. It also makes my salary much lower. It's not okay and they have to put the food aside when the customers ordering online is the next order to be made\n",
      "11. O'snack is terrible, they treat courriers like dogs waiting for very long while 20 bags are on a table, on display for the long line of tortured Wolt courriers waiting, only to be teased for all of eternity\n",
      "12. Less payment. Long wait to get ready food\n",
      "13. Today both La Pizza and Kylling Co, both in Varde, had late deliveries. They marked it as “order ready” but in fact, nothing was ready. So I would like to ask them to only inform “order ready” when the order is actually ready. Kind regards, Bianca.\n",
      "14. Hope you can do something with all that wait at Macd .. It's an hour for me every day ..\n",
      "15. Green Mango order was cancelled. I arrived. Said it wasn't supposed to be ready for another 15 minutes. On my display it was ready, and I arrived 2 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Not cool that there's no compensation for waiting extra 10-15 minutes during dinner rush. And certainly not cool that there's no compensation for driving all the way to the venue for nothing. Find the faulty person and shake your head, whilst staring at them with huge disappointment, please!\n",
      "16. McDonald's has an excessive waiting time\n",
      "17. McDonald's Valby (Gammel Køge Landevej, has a special place for handing over takeaway orders. Unfortunately, it is not staffed, which can be extremely frustrating when waiting to get an order that is either marked ready, or should be marked ready. And it is an obvious priority of, for example, Wolt's customers, with the physical customers who can turn to a manner of a manner ...\n",
      "18. Waiting too long for the food to get done\n",
      "19. Kebab Palace is really slow every single time I have to pick up from there which makes a desire not to pick up from there\n",
      "20. McDonalds branches has to improve their take out attention to Wolt partners\n",

      "2. Don't remember the name, nine. She was way too slow with her answers, about 10 min for each response in our chat\n",
      "3. I had a case where I was not able to pick up the items because another courier already tool them, and I wrote to support and had the order made and I delivered it. My complaint is I lost 25 minutes of time to a mistake someone else made and did not get compensated for it, I would like to ask for this to be changed, cause I lost out on an entire orders worth of time\n",
      "4. I will be back soon !!!\n",

      "6. It passed about 40 minutes before I got help from support\n",
      "7. It passed 15 min before support replied\n",
      "8. With the quick response from support team it makes task easier\n",
      "9. It’s really infuriating that support is built to make sure Wolt pats as as little as possible . What’s the point of giving extra effort if we get penalised for it and our time is wasted\n",
      "10. My account is dysfunctional still. I can’t work\n",
      "11. Great with the new customer chat feature!\n",
      "12. MacD had some issues with the IT. Took a lot of time in peak hours. Strange normally they are some of the best. WOLT support was absolutely world-class today\n",
      "13. Please operation team contact with me asap. Otherwise I can not start working.\n",
      "14. Please make it possible to cancel an order instead of contacting support. Unfortunately, experience a wait of +5 min at Venues. And understandingly they are busy, but who bring out is time = money\n",
      "15. Stupid new system I'm stopping working with you\n",
      "16. Support is very friendly ording, however, I would like it so that I can go offline myself without trouble supporting it\n",
      "17. Wolt support too bad, very slow\n",
      "18. They deducted money from me for a mistake I did not do, and I was also unable to complete my work for this reason It’s not an acceptable, sorry. Why should I pay for the resturant mistake?! I received the order from the resturant after I let them control my mobile (they saw it), then I delivered it. How can I know the in package details?!\n",
      "19. You have the best system it runs smoothly everytime, no problems whatsoever, I dont think you have change anything, and your support is also the best they always have a solution for everything, you should give them a raise especially the ones i have been in contact with today\n",
      "20. No work, terrible support\n",
      "\n",
      " -- Topic 4 -- \n",
      "1. It’s fine. Could be some small tweaks to the app, such as when opening the app from lock screen it jumps to the chat so I have to close it down. Sometimes when the app gives me bundles, if the first order is finished early or sometimes even just finished on time, the next order will maybe have 10+ minute wait and not so high pay, so it rarely makes sense to accept those.\n",
      "2. I had problems with the app\n",

Distance kilometres is not accurate sometimes also show example 67kk but paid 52dkk. This is not complaint. 4. Pick time I accept a order so far from restaurant. There is no restaurant there so need again come back otherwise no order so like this area should add money. So this is not complaint. Just my observation.\n",

      "2. Restaurants should be more aware of telling you what soda/drink to include on the order. Besides this, some of the restaurants' recycling bags are impractical and cause leakage/waste if one is not really careful\n",

      "4. I forgot to come with feedback after my guard so here it is. I once again had 2 bad experiences with packaging that were not close. This provides an extremely bad experience for the customer. As a bid, this is clearly what I see as the biggest problem and I would advise you to go in and make demands on the restaurants regarding the packaging. You could even make your own packaging that the restaurants can buy. It is alpha-omega that all containers are hamitically closed and can withstand tilt or even stand upside down if it ends like that. If it makes the packaging more expensive then it is good that there is a statutory charge and the restaurants can even make a mortgage system so that customers can come back with the packaging and get money back (when they have to pick up food Aha, win win). Of course, it will require the packaging to be reusable, but it is just positive for the environment and the business.\n",

As courier we get paid to pick up and deliver, not to pack an order and pick up drinks in is a refrigerator at the back of the restaurant. This is a problem especially at Berlin Døns on Nørrebrogade. It creates delay and bad energy when there are plenty of employees in the restaurant who can easily make sure that drinks are handed out with the order.\n",

I delivered two orders and the bags both broke due to leaking packing. 1st orders bag broke directly as I handed to the customer, the second i had to arrange the mess into something deliverable.

It doesn't worth it anymore to deliver over 3km. We have to pay 100% of our expenses and the prices are super low. Let the bundles be the full price as before! 35kr for a bundle task over 4km??? When we actually have to drive 1-2-3 km from first drop of to the second??? This is insane\n",

Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich.

         "['Hi! Today started great but the few times I’ve run into issues it’s always been at McDonald’s, which I would like to address in this message, because it affects not only me but other couriers and customers also. First of all I always respect each vendors’ instructions such as always bringing my bag into the venue etc. and if you look at McDonald’s instructions it says: 1. Show the order on your phone to the staff 2. Swipe order as picked-up 3. Get the bag with the food Sometimes they get angry if you don’t follow this but I don’t think it makes sense why only McDonald’s have these special instructions when no other vendor does? Today when I walked in the order #980 was already at -27 minutes and I showed it to the staff, at 13.16 I swiped right according to the instructions because I thought it was ready and did the same thing with the other two tasks #985 and #986, which were handed to me immediately but upon further waiting the staff told me that #980 had been “lost in their system” and that they would need to remake it and it would be done in “maybe 15 minutes” and that I should write to Wolt to remove the order. At 13.27 I write to Wolt to explain the situation asking if I should wait or remove. Wolt support asked me to wait for pickup. So I waited a little longer and then asked the staff whether I should wait for the order but he simply told me “We are very busy, somebody else will pick up that order” so at 13.34 I write to support again and ask for a removal even though I wanted to wait for pickup. At 13.40 wolt support removed the order and I leave McDonald’s after almost 30 minutes of being there to continue my deliveries. Then at 14.11, almost one hour after I first received order #980, I get the exact same order #980 from McDonald’s to the same customer, and pick it up. Of course I wondered why nobody else had picked it up earlier but maybe it wasn’t ready until I came, I don’t know, but when I arrived to the customer I saw she was very upset, which is understandable so after giving her the food I tried to explain kindly that McDonalds had to make the order twice but it didn’t help she just slammed the door before I could finish my sentence. We are all human and make mistakes but in this case McDonalds had 27 minutes to take care of this “lost order” either by contacting Wolt directly or informing me as a courier before swiping. I learned my lesson and will never again swipe unless the order is given to me, no matter how angry staff gets because I don’t want to go through this kind of inconvenience I went through today because it feels really bad for me to contact Wolt support about issues such as these. Wolt support was of course amazing and kind towards me but I hope that McDonald’s will change these special instructions and that someone will think of an idea to make the pick-up experience at McDonalds as smooth and as professional as in other venues. Thank you for taking your time to read this! David', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', \"I had an unacceptable experience at McDonald's, i arrive and the order should've been ready 5 minutes ago, i wait at the Wolt pickup line for about 10 minutes, before I get impatient and say excuse me before I ask for someone if my order is being prepared. Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\"]"

Began as courier 5 months ago (it may well be described as relatively new), but today\\'s \"experience\" then gives rise to high blood pressure… I write in in the afternoon (at 16 o\\'clock I think) because I can see in the Wolt App where customers order that they are closed and/or only the possibility of pickup. I ask in the Partner app why there is closed, etc. “There can be many reasons” I am told .. After 20 min. Is the recommendation that I should shut down the app, restart my phone and open the app again. It didn\\'t help. Then she finds out that the city is not open to deliveries .. 25 min. Should it go from I approached ... whether she was able to open it again, or if she got help, I have no idea, but open it was ... but only for a short while. So \"closed\" the city again for delivery .. I have never, until today, experienced this \"phenomenon\" that just shuts down for deliveries. And I wondered when, after all, I was online and drove .. So big is Thisted and the surrounding area, after all .. I did not contact myself again and again got hold of one in the partner support that, like most of the others, must not / can / will inform anything. Whether they had tried to send push messages out to the other couriers, etc. \"Unfortunately, I must not disclose that\" .. What for something ?? Is it so secret that your internal guidelines mean that I, as an active courier, must not know such information? As I wrote in the Partner Support, I wouldn\\'t \"waste\" my time being online if the city is shut down anyway? For how long would go? Would it open again, etc.? No help to pick up .. But I was welcome to call the courier .. I tried it so .. got hold of an English speaker .. who tried to quiet. No one took the phone. The English speaker tried again. No one took the phone. He tried again. I finally came through to a Danish -speaking support that thought it was \"wild\" that her from the partner support had pointed out that I could call in. Since they have no more information on the courier line than they have in the partner support .. Asked him a few questions on the phone and the response was something in the direction of \"now I have to take care I don\\'t tell too much\" .. So .. why all the secret? Why not be open and tell how the situation is. Then I also have a better opportunity to assess whether I should stay online (as well as hold and wait too long for you to press a button that allows people to order food for delivery again) .. It is difficult sometimes to see your act. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to get in touch with a person who can and will help .. The only time I really feel there is help to pick up is if I get an order that I would like to get rid of, as it is far from ready, while I may have a few other orders to lie in the car in the heat/cool the bags .. pretty much everything else does not matter. It\\'s a gossip for a gossip. \"I can\\'t disclose that,\" \"I must not tell,\" \"Our internal guidelines mean that I cannot get closer to this\" .. Amen, it is crazy sometimes .. And no matter how incredible it sounds, I am actually happy to run food out like Wolt Kurer. I am passionate about good service. I am passionate about making people happy and satisfied. But I really miss being greeted right away with the people I turn to to get help. Incidentally, I still miss the answer from both the HR department and the “OPS Team” .. Yes, there are cases .. Yes, there are more from the Partner Support who either move for answers or even created new cases as it should increase the chance of a feedback / response. Why should one case not be enough?', 'I got some unknown error messages when trying to accept orders. Other than that, the app worked well', 'Haven’t got my first order yet otherwise app worked well']"

Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed.

You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

If I deliver a wrong order, its my fault and I have to pay (not the venuen when the responsability is shared) If a venue has 30 minutes of delay, and you drove 10 minutes-2km wasting fuel and time, you loose. You dont have a compensations. You dont get nothing. And when you ask support, they seem monkeys behind a keyboard. They are fast to deduct money from your savings but when you ask something to help you, they always answer another completly different thing. Its impossible like this. I want to make a complaint and support told me that this form is a complaint. And no its not. They are liars. A good company dont have liars in their team specially when they have conctact with “providers” as we are. Wolt is sucking in all ways. Is not a good place to work specially if you are a courier. You are alone. Nobody supports or take care about you. I am guessing is anyone will read this and reach out to me. Don’t think so. I know that this is all for nothing…', \"I am charged with some of 90 kroner for a restaurant that has a little boy behind the box that does not hear the difference from orders 896 and 892. It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

      "1. ATTENTION PLEASE: Ok so it happened now for the second time that I accept a task, bike all the way to the venue and once there I don't have the task anymore. The first time I contacted support but they couldn't (or wouldn't) help me. This time I understood what happens in these cases: by the time I accepted the task and arrived there to the venue the order got canceled. This last time the venue itself canceled by mistake (they wanted the reject a later order that they couldn't make in time and not my order that they have made already). The first time I don't know who canceled it (venue or customer). The point is when this happend you cannot just take the task away without some sort of notification (possibly with sound too or something). What if I biked 15 or 20 minutes all the way to the venue for nothing? I understand the customer or venue can decide to reject the task but the courier needs to be notified right away. The app right now basically just goes back to \"waiting for tasks\" silently with the courier still thinking that he's biking/driving to pick up a task. What makes it even worse is that when I contacted support they \"don't know what I'm talking about cause they cannot see I took any task\". The app needs to be amended. (This last time I got at least my 35 kr for having biked all the way to the venue but the first time I got nothing.\n",

      "6. Really happy about everything related to Wolt and most partners. However there is a general problem with some of the larger and smaller restaurants pushing the “order is ready”, while in reality we end up waiting 5-15 minutes for the order. Especially Hubbs Kitchen, both Frederiksberg and Nordvestare some of the biggest ones in this. As couriers we miss out reaching boost goals, when we are kept waiting, two Hubbs orders can destroy the tarvet of reaching 12 orders before 20.00.\n",

When you receive an order and have to pick up the food, the dot is not over the same with the real distinction where the food is to be delivered it is very much next to 500 meters and it is very much inside the middle of the city it must definitely be fixed as it only creates problems I suggest you allow us to see the address of it where the food is to be delivered while we are in the process of collecting the food on it can both save time so you do not have to spend 1 to 2 minutes to find out where it is and how to get there and it can be done while the food is finalized but overall it is good\n",

I would like you to notice that you care about the customers and the restaurants that's good but please you have to give an eye to your Drivers which they are the real Wolt they are your team (your right and left hands) I feel you are working against them by bringing all the time more new partners, by this method you simply take tasks from your old and senior drivers which they have experience and give them to a new unknown driver, and nobody do this thing you have to PROTECT your old people because they are tested and deserve to be respected. you with this way forcing them to find another job because you are making the work not worthy. And did you do simple you change your good drivers with new ones not sure about them. I heard from many old colleagues Wolt is dying wolt becoming not worthy. Example 2021 old parenter average 10 tasks 2022 New driver average 5 tasks old partner average 5 tasks 2023 ? You have to stop this bleeding and no accept new drivers without needing them. Protect your team Protect your drivers income. Thank you I will repeat sending this feedback again.\n",

Something needs to be done about this, otherwise you’ll have no couriers left to deliver the orders, I know for a fact that I’m not the only one compalining about this, since I hear other couriers talk about the same EVERY day. Do something before you lose your slaves “wolt couriers” because it’s unprofessional and absolutely unaaceptable.\n",

      "5. At split orders, would it be possible to add \"new\" order numbers to the \"new\" orders? Ex. 1. A courier rejects a big order with order number 222 because he will not carry it. 2. The order is being split, so two new couriers can pick it up. 3. The next courier arrives, but in this case he is being provided with order number 222A, and takes the first part of the order. Meanwhile the next courier is already on his way, and it would be a waste of his time and money if he should not pick up anything. 4. The next courier arrives and he is being provided with the order number 222B, and picks up the second half of the order. The only thing the staff have to do is add an A and a B to the order numbers on the bags in for example the supermarket Meny. Just something like this so we don't have to waste a lot of time talking with staff and support about what happened because a courier picked up all items in a split order, which made everyone confused about what really happened, and why the last courier is there with an order number, but seemingly nothing to pick up.\n",

I can go in to MC Frb to buy a coffee as theres 15 CP parking.

Fx if you already got an order in the bag, that takes up half the space, so you accept a new one to fill out the bag, but the new takes up more than half of the space.

Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\", 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”']"

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

      "8. I took an order from a place, and when I arrived, they told me that the order was to pick in an hour from that time. If wolt allowes to the people to order on a specific time, they should write somewhere in the task so the courier can know and reject it if it’s not useful, or they should send the task to the courier when is going to be ready, not one hour before, because I lost time going to the venue and also I got no compensation for it. For that time wolt support was really slow and took 15 minutes to unassign the task. Really disappointed today\n",

I get order from kiin kiin restaurant, when I arrived to the restaurant it was closed , I wrote to support and they said to me the restaurant is open , I told support the restaurant I closed and sent video to the support but they told me that not true . I road 2,5 km free . Always give us wrong addresses and wrong names. The support today was very bad\n",

I did swipp before getiu the order which it's not normally this way.I told her she first needs to give me the bag and then I will swipp in front of her . She started to shout at me saying I'm not listening to her. I told her I will report her to Wolt support. She said pls do. Really an unpleasant person that looks she hate her job and people in general\n",

      "1. Mcd needs to get a better way of packing their drinks. They put it in a paper bag and then if it tips over it spills all over your bag. Either they need a cup with a screw on lid that is tight as a bottle or maybe use some foil under the lid (like a juice from eg. joe and the juice). We ride on all sorts of surfaces incl. cobblestone and also has to reach down to lock our bikes now and then. It can also happen with the food in other restaurants and that is almost worse since your bag smells and are hard to clean when you get home. So in general to demand a higher standard for the packaging would make the couriers happier and give the customers a better experience (by that I mean no ruined food or half portions) The map in the courier app has 2 small flaws. 1, the pickup, delivery, and courier mark disappear at the bottom (if in centered/update mode)where the order details can be swiped up. This can make it hard to guess where you are. 2, when you get really close to your target the map is to zoomed (in centered mode). It would be nice to be able to set a max zoom distance/min visible area in the settings\n",

The should also have better lids to insure that the drink doesn't spill\n",

It's not something we have to drive in a regular passenger car where the goods need to be lifted up in a trunk, you have to have a bag and a van for something so big and heavy! The staff also looked at it doubtfully, saying that it was the first time they had picked up something as heavy as the furniture with Wolt. Get it stopped before things go wrong, please!\n",
      "9. Some fast food joints should start packing drinks better, it’s not a big issue, but the drinks are dripping, and the acid from the soda damages the bag, which we have to pay ourselves. Also, customers might think the drink is spilled if they see some drops running down the cups. Burger King, Carl Jr’s and a few other ones. In other countries a layer of plastic is put on the drinks.

You are looking for new couriers and yours are looking for tasks it doesn't make sense. Thank you\n",
      "19. Working as a courier for Wolt is everyday a little more depressing\n",
      "20. Too many couriers and no orders\n"

Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km, can give 24,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Personally I reject all order to less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out, which us cures that are left can not reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results.

I find a number of times that customers on site are prioritized, rather than Couriers who are politely waiting for orders .. Ask Burger King on Ellebjergvej 142 (Valby Syd) to remember to mark orders ready, have experienced a number of times standing and waiting a long time just to discover that the order has been ready for a long time', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"Please do something about the bags. Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\"]"

After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake.

      "=== Topic 12 (90 documents) ===\n",
      "1. Why the F do I have to ask support everytime I want to cancel an order. I have enough experience to know when I have to cancel and when not. I’ve done 550 orders this month alone, let me cancel whenever want without support please\n",
      "2. The two layers of support you have to go through to get anything done are highly frustrating and time wasting. Also if a task is to pickup a missing item from a previous order please let us know about it. Twice today I had venues flatly tell me they had no such order only to find out after 10 minutes back and forth with support that it was for a missing item.\n",
      "3. Please make it possible to cancel an order instead of contacting support. Unfortunately, experience a wait of +5 min at Venues. And understandingly they are busy, but who bring out is time = money\n",
      "4. I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.\n",
      "5. I have received errors on order today where I had not been handed the item to the customer but was still sent to the wrong customer with the wrong goods and deleted another customer delivery It is only because I am known in the area and lived there all my life that I knew where to deliver it really badly from the system and at the same time I did not get payment for one order if it was not because I had double checked it,\n",
      "6. Support take so long to resolve a problem it looks like they never understand what the issue or how to solve it. They gave me the wrong order in the restaurant. In understand it's my fault. So they need to be fast to charge me the amount and give a straight answer right away to keep going.\n",
      "7. Poor service that was removed for me DKK 457. Justify that I have handed in order for only wrong and it was not my problem and I have been customer service agree but she did not agree with me then she removes me without her telling me that I will remove from you 457 kr. It has asked me that I have delivered it wrong then I say to them no I have handed in it it is real customers and I have also said to them maybe they may well be that him as he works in the student Seven who was he lives the order then he writes on the bus order number wrong\n",
      "8. One of the support service tried to take 217 kr from my money because of restaurant mistake and I hope some supervisor from Wolt to talk to me .\n",
      "9. Very very bad support. I got an order that I accepted. When I went to the place to get my order the order got cancelled. So I waited a very long time for the support to delete the order so I could continue. On top of all I did not get compensated for the lost time or fuel I used or anything\n",
      "10. Every time a real issue comes up, like customers not responding, wrong addresses, badly packaged food making a mess, support does nothing to help. We get no compensation. Instead it's always the same answer: \"I'm sorry this happened to you, better luck next time\". It's a constant reminder of how little our time and effort matters to the company.\n",
      "11. Youtake money off from your staff even when it is not their fault\n",
      "12. The support is the WORST. I think I will find another job because you do everything to wear away the riders and remembee that wolt exits because of the riders. We always loose. If I deliver a wrong order, its my fault and I have to pay (not the venuen when the responsability is shared) If a venue has 30 minutes of delay, and you drove 10 minutes-2km wasting fuel and time, you loose. You dont have a compensations. You dont get nothing. And when you ask support, they seem monkeys behind a keyboard. They are fast to deduct money from your savings but when you ask something to help you, they always answer another completly different thing. Its impossible like this. I want to make a complaint and support told me that this form is a complaint. And no its not. They are liars. A good company dont have liars in their team specially when they have conctact with “providers” as we are. Wolt is sucking in all ways. Is not a good place to work specially if you are a courier. You are alone. Nobody supports or take care about you. I am guessing is anyone will read this and reach out to me. Don’t think so. I know that this is all for nothing…\n",
      "13. My account is set to do recieve only alcohol free orders today after I got an order and accept I went to the venue and picked up the order i felt there are some cans so i asked to make sure if it contain alc and surprisingly IT WAS. So the order was canceled and i did not get compensation for this distance and wasted time. And guess what this happened again and I detect that after i reached the venue and also i did not get compensation for this fault that is repeated from the application\n",
      "14. Vendor concerns are not being heard\n",
      "15. negative rating from support because they withheld funds from my earnings due to alleged non-delivery! The support representative promised that he would investigate with someone else and let me know the results. I will give the support a negative rating until I see these results.\n",
      "16. I mixed up two orders. But I was able to go pick up the order that I had delivered incorrectly and exchange them and have both orders delivered correctly within 10 or 15 minutes. But the support service just calculated a fine for me. And she didn’t give me the opportunity to do it right. Now this money is very important to me. And I think what the support team did was wrong.\n",
      "17. If I took orders and delivered them to the client, this order is wrong, I am responsible for it, so it is not fair because it is not my fault if they gave me the wrong order.\n",
      "18. My earnings is getting cancelled because a customer is saying that they didn’t got their order. And I am 100% sure that I have delivered to right address. It’s very disappointing that the courier doesn’t have any rights.\n",
      "19. Gastronomia Italia order 268. I arrived. Confirmed my order number is 2 6 8. They confirm and ask multiple times if it's 2 6 8. After I get it, I swipe. But they say I didn't swipe. I show them the order on my phone. They show me the order on their tablet, saying the order is 2 6 9.... I say mine is 2 6 8. They don't understand why 2 6 8 is my order, and not 2 6 9... They insist they gave me order 2 6 9, even though we agreed multiple times that I came for order 2 6 8.. I should receive compensation on behalf of their mistake.\n",
      "20. For the Order no: 923 from Yazzy's Pita the customer claims he didn't get the right fucking Order. Even he got something else he ate it and I still got deducted an amount of 223/- DKK from my end and then the customer once again gets a fucking solution. If you had to deduct the money from me then you should have atleast asked the customer to return the Order. The customer checked the Order in front of me. He got more than be bargained for. This is the last time you did this. One more time you do this I will go public with this harrasment. You have started paying less to Wolt Couriers. No more with this bullshit.\n",
      "21. Very sad about this situation support treated me very bad. I am stressed and sad I could not do my job properly because that . Cecile discount me 200 dk even with out ask me nothing. Hopefully some one could solve this situation fairly.\n",
      "22. I am still being penalized for notifying a work injury\n",
      "23. negative rating from support because they withheld funds from my earnings due to alleged non-delivery. I delivered the order exactly to the address indicated in the order. I couldn’t make a mistake with the apartment, since the order indicated “stuen”, without specifying whether the apartment was on the right or left, and there was also only one “stuen” button on the intercom! my opinion is that the client decided to cheat by sending his girlfriend to receive the order (who, by the way, was already waiting for me on the landing after my call on the intercom)! I understand that the amount of 44 kr is not that big, but the very fact of fraud haunts me and you play along with it!\n",
      "24. I did not get £ 45 on order which I have handed in and support will not understand\n",
      "25. There could well be a feature where you could undo an order after accepting. If, for example, there is an order in a store where they are behind with many orders\n"

         "['Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'More than one restaurant marked the order as ready before it was and made me wait.', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Distance shown on to the app map got increased after we accept the order but the sad things is we are not getting any payment for additional ride. What distance show in the app also doesn’t match with the real road map. This is injustice. You are making money out of US. 2. For long distance order we are not paid sufficiently. According to the single order you are giving ideal amount but while we take long distance order you pay a very poor amount that is truly injustice but you are receiving full delivery charge from the customer and paying your hero’s less. 3. For multiple order you are adding additional amount for the rider but taking full amount from the customer is high was not seen before in wolt. Many of the rider are furious about this changes. We work for you even in the rain, storm or snow. You should pay us accordingly not snitch our hard earned money. Payment should be provided accordingly to the pickup to delivery distance for individual order not like additional distance and you take the full amount paying us on for additional ride. 4. In the worst weather we are not treated or paid respectfully. We deliver with cold, slippery road and always have chances to fall in accidents. In those case you should increase or boost the payment minimum 30% . But what I see you only boost 10% which is not enough, not at all. I hope you will consider those matter and collaborate with us.

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

      "1. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. This time was extra special.. I literally drive 2 kilometers from Ingrid Marievej 8, Valby back towards old Valby. I go slow, but no orders. And to no great surprise, I get not one but two orders, as soon as I am back in old Valby. And both orders are late for pick up, so I find it very likely that they have been offered in the market for a minimum of four minutes before they are due for pickup. Just know that it’s very annoying to a courier, and in my case lead me to not accept the next bundle offered by the app..\n",
      "2. Venues marking the order ready when its not ready and waiting 10-20 mins for the order,the app sucks battery like crazy and if connected to bt,lowers all volumes.\n",
      "3. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. ABSOLUTE JOKE TODAY. THE LEVEL OF MANIPULATION IS BEYOND BELIEF.\n",
      "4. In my opinion we could have integration with smartwatch for confirming the orders and especially an app designed for Android auto, it would be a plus not having to touch the mobile phone while driving\n",
      "5. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. Such a joke.\n",
      "6. Often times the app will be slow to update my location while I'm biking. Also Restaurant Vita had an unfriendly staff at the door and Pizza Art had about 25-30min delay. Otherwise all the other venues were great.\n",
      "7. App is assigning Long distance order and i am in cycle. Ot would have been better if i Can restrict the Delivery area myself\n",
      "8. Have a list of someone who could be nice. 1. The Belob that you see for you accept an order it could be nice to still keep it so you still show it when you swipe up to see Contact Information / The address of the Customer Sa Star there below \"Belob: XXX\" 2. Make a feedback menu item in sidebar menu so when you press the burger menu SA STAR DER FEEDBACK SA when you press it then a window comes where you can write your feedback without having to log out / swipe offline. 3. Does not make sense to me that you write on and off task distance as in gore now, just keep distance it as it stood for without there Star on and off Distance Task.\n",
      "9. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. I literally drive 4km, and surprise I get an order when I’m at the venue, an order that’s almost ready (1 minute) ABSOLUTE JOKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "10. The application did not work well - the location update was done at long intervals, for this reason you had to wait 4-5 minutes before you could swipe the received order -with normal and busy status, in 1 hour and 30 minutes I received 3 orders - after long periods of waiting, I received the orders ready and delayed - a second order is pending and by the time you reach the location to pick up the first one it disappears, it is pointless to be displayed until you drive 2-3 km and then disappear - I received the order for a new customer, ready and delayed, to travel to the venue 6 km, after picking up the estimated time for delivery 3 min. for 4.5 km, driving safely is a priority\n",
      "11. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. Absolute joke\n",
      "12. It would be great if there is an option where I can restrict the delivery area or mark proffered delivery area in the map. Probably after having , you can force us to take bundle orders without rejecting\n",
      "13. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue Insane miles\n",
      "14. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. PLEASE PLEASE change the programming of the app, so it offer us orders BEFORE we cross a big intersection, or turn a corner. It is super annoying and somewhat dangerous to have to do all these U-turns.. Also my app doesn’t really register how many miles I drive, I estimate less than 20 % is registered this month\n",
      "15. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. ITS SUCH AN EXPERIENCE\n",
      "16. I've been at work for 12 hours and I have nine races and the rest have 20 race tracks, it's something abnormal, I talked to wolt employees from the chat and they didn't help me with anything, this is not normal, I bought two phones to be always connected and for nothing, I'm the only one from this area that doesn't have orders\n",
      "17. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue Insane Miles driven\n",
      "18. Drive 2 km no orders and then get offered almost ready task when I have just passed the store…\n",
      "19. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. Big joke\n",
      "20. App lets me drive for miles, then offers order when I’m close to the venue, and as an extra bonus, the order is quite late because you wait to offer it…\n",
      "21. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. PLEASE PLEASE STOP THIS MANIPULATION. IT WLL COME BACK TO YOU ONE DAY…\n",
      "22. Today I had 3 occasions in which I waited more than 25 minutes for an order to be removed, the longest one was approximately 15 minutes the other 2 times. I also had problems with the GPS, it said that the pickup distance was less than where I was... my location was not updated in the application... and it was not a problem with my GPS... I did a huge amount of kilometers for so little money that I was able to raise. What a shame.\n",
      "23. Today's I have some troubles because app, mix the order, and I can't deliver. Support finally help, but It takes a lot of time. And the venue had so troubles with the prepare on time. Hard day.\n",
      "24. App lets me drive for miles, then offers almost ready order when I’m close to the venue. BIG JOKE. SSAM at Fisketorvet take more than 15 minutes to toast two buns, and it looked like the only orders they had. BIG JOKE.\n",
      "25. Hi. 1. Some venues have almost no way to reach by car. I have parked in a parking, paid 10kr in a 300m distance. I think they must have mostly bike or if you send a car it must be much more expensive. 2. Some roads are closed and google map is bad so the time estimates and price should be different. Fx, It is 1 km away but I have to drive 6 or 7 km to reach. 3. Venues mark orders ready while I have to wait 30 minutes there and they say it is because they can see other others. Like bellisimo pizza and eat not hojbjerg.\n"

I find a number of times that customers on site are prioritized, rather than Couriers who are politely waiting for orders .. Ask Burger King on Ellebjergvej 142 (Valby Syd) to remember to mark orders ready, have experienced a number of times standing and waiting a long time just to discover that the order has been ready for a long time', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed.

Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\"]"

One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me.

After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay.

      "2. When the weather is like this right now (storms/rain/snowy), you should raise the payment for every order by 25% to 30%. That will motivate the couriers to work on these days. Putting 3x effort than the usual on a day like this, getting vehicle spoilt, and getting paid the same is something where Wolt has failed me.\n",
      "3. The payments given are low. Night workers should receive extra payment.\n",
      "4. STOP INCOMING PEOPLE IN AALBORG!!! RISE THE PAYMENT\n",
      "5. Wolt does not behave fairly. During 1.5 hours in one place, I was without an order, but the other colleagues had several orders\n",
      "6. Whats going on with Wolt that is super dead? People don’t order anymore? Don’t think so. Maybe the competition is taking wolts place? Used to be great but now is just CRAP\n",
      "7. The orders are very low and the amount that Volt pays is very low\n",
      "8. Bad experience. Seems you are to keep all money for yourself. After taxes and expenses the earnings are around 50 to 60 kr per hour. Do something with second order price. Otherwise people are getting frustrated. It seems you are changing the prices according to the situation.\n",
      "9. Not worth the hard work anymore. You keep all the money on double orders and at the same time you reduce all task fees with 5-10kr.\n",

      "2. It will be very usefull if you add to notifications we got when there is an order that need to be picked, the time that order need to be picked at and when it need to be delivered! In case like when i am for example not close to centrum so i either calculate if can pick and deliver or let it to another person who is closer. So the food is hot and get cold.\n",
      "3. KFC Rådhuspladsen was not able to handle the amount of orders they were sent in a very short while. Maybe there should be a cap of how many orders can be made within a certain timeframe. It's frustrating going to a venue only to find out they are unable to cope, and the order I'm supposed to pick up won't be ready within the foreseeable future even though it's already 35 minutes overdue. This was a special event, because of the Superbowl. But this should be looked into. After waiting in vain at the venue, I decided to decline every order from them. And it was a lot!!! No way they could handle that amount.\n",

I find a number of times that customers on site are prioritized, rather than Couriers who are politely waiting for orders .. Ask Burger King on Ellebjergvej 142 (Valby Syd) to remember to mark orders ready, have experienced a number of times standing and waiting a long time just to discover that the order has been ready for a long time', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"Please do something about the bags. Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\"]"

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

      "1. This is not a complaint, but I would like to draw your attention to the behavior of the Volt Market Soborg employees. Firstly, they are in no hurry to give orders to the couriers, sometimes pretending that they simply do not notice the couriers, that they are standing and waiting for their orders. And secondly, they give orders with such an air as if they are doing someone a favor. Frankly speaking, on some shifts you don’t even want to take orders there because of such behavior of the staff. I hope that you will help them to respect the couriers a little, since this is your structure and you have a direct influence on them.\n",
      "2. Wolt needs to do something about the venues who mark the order as ready and it's not ready. We loose time going to the venue, expecting the order is ready. When we get there they say it's not ready and that we need to wait 10 or 15+ min until it's ready. This makes us riders loose time and energy. And of course money. It's not fair for us riders. Venues who exceed the time for the order should be penalized in some way. Because it's us riders who at the end of the day end up loosing nad being penalized (for being on time to pick up the order? ) I hope Wolt resolves this issue as soon as possible, because it's very frustrating. And affects our income very bad\n",
      "3. Who take orders over 60-75 kr ??? Only special \"curiers\" like Roxana ???\n",
      "4. I don't know if it's the app or to meny currier/drivers. But the last week I worked from 11 to around 13:30 o'clock with so few orders that I actually lost money on gas and time on it. Just take today's peak time 1 hour and 34 minutes and got only 1 order on 40kr drove the whole city so meny times. There most be a solution on this matter.\n",

      "3. It is very very difficult to collect 3 deliveries from three restaurants within the city of Aalborg because as a car driver we can’t go in all the streets. So it is time to rethink the policy of combine order from different restaurants as it is time consuming and too much stress for car drivers. Instead it is better to collect 2-3 orders from same restaurant and delivery different locations in the similar direction or a little bit deviating direction. We can’t earn that much the way we are working hard and taking all the risk on the road. There are lot of options to be more efficient.\n",

It’s really bad and insulting for good and educated people like us.\n",
      "6. When the customer has chosen contact-free delivery, it says in app that I need to wait until the customer opens the door, but some customers don't know that the courier needs to wait for them to open the door, so sometimes (not so often though) it takes a long time for that to happen. Maybe it could be made clearer to the customers?\n",

You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you have set our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing of 450 meters when the reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km, can give 24,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Personally I reject all order to less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out and made up to 3 times I have experienced, as us cures who are left can not reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results.

I can only find out the order's contents when I arrive at the restaurant and the staff hands it over to me. It wouldn't be fair to request that I reject the order at that moment because it would mean wasting a lot of time, including the time it took to get to the supermarket and the time spent waiting for a new order. Last night, I had to carry 10 bottles of oil from SPAR, in addition to an existing order in my backpack, and carrying all of this on my back is not healthy. It would be beneficial to find a solution to prevent this from happening.

However on busy days like today, and snowy weather, where you're held up in ultra slow traffic, the tasks could pay better. Especially the bundles fees, as arriving to the venues and customers take extra long time in these weather conditions. Otherwise all is good!\n",
      "10. Get back to old payment method! It's more clear! Now we don't know, you just se the price that you like for the tasks, really unfair. Km deduction!!!! It doesn't worth it anymore to deliver over 3km. We have to pay 100% of our expenses and the prices are super low. Let the bundles be the full price as before! 35kr for a bundle task over 4km??? When we actually have to drive 1-2-3 km from first drop of to the second??? This is insane\n",

What they do they ask for the order, pick up it and they don't swipe to start delivery, they cancel the order, but they already stole the food. So when I show up and ask for the order in the venue they say \"is already picked\". I always tell the workers in the venues to ask the courier to show them how they swipe before they leave. And I think is very easy for you to find out who is doing this, you have the courier in your system and to punish him.\n",

I find a number of times that customers on site are prioritized, rather than Couriers who are politely waiting for orders .. Ask Burger King on Ellebjergvej 142 (Valby Syd) to remember to mark orders ready, have experienced a number of times standing and waiting a long time just to discover that the order has been ready for a long time', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

We have no control of the drinks. It’s a mess. And it takes up so much space. Bundles of 3 are not possible anymore. Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"Please do something about the bags. Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\"]"

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did.

But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

The r destination, yesterday 35-120 kr lunch time! Is that good? Want to work for 35 kr/ or whatever get entered in the system per hour process is running on? Be honest.

I understand by the pattern that this may have come from you. If unfortunately this is like that, let me tell you that this is not good. It’s not good to put my time and the planning I do in terms of the type of orders I want to accept at someone else’s disposal.

You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you have set our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing of 450 meters when the reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km, can give 24,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Personally I reject all order to less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out and made up to 3 times I have experienced, as us cures who are left can not reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results.

We who actually move this company …. respect do you know how much cost 1 tire of the car in dk ? I have to work 3 days in wolt to change just 1 flat tire of my car ! You thing that’s fairly and good job . I like to be flexible but last months looks like im forced to stop. Because instead of earning money i pay by myself to do it and mantein a car\n",

You can see the opportunity to reach more, you press it to be removed/taken then you have to have a longer period of time because you had to not. No bundle or long or anything. One becomes completely physically, mentally, financially smashed, why? Constant 35s every 15-20 min? When driving a whole way apart in vain trip and spending time, be better reward!\n",

Over 6 hours of none stop driving totally in vain BGA something in the background that happens. There was a lot to do and you had to do and it typically every 10,11,12.13 time for everyday life. So Is it good? Normal? Justice? 35kr!? So fine maybe, 1 hour where is it completely dead, why when time and order is busy and much to make you drive even less? Bundles are prohibited by hand, whether it is short or long distance? It's really scary that driver/ set to run on. 35! Thank you so much\n",
      "8. The flexibility is really what sets Wolt apart from my other jobs, it's great to be able to have some flexibility with my schedule while studying. I very much enjoy the exercise I get from it as well. Things to improve would be some sort of guarentee or payment when delays happen which are out of our control as couriers. We can report delays which I was told punishes the venues, but It happens often enough that it doesn't seem to discourage the behavior. Since I'm biking I could imagine people on scooters who are faster are affected by this even more. Also the distance bonus isn't really worth it, I've started denying orders that are far cause it makes the 180-200per hour impossible, as one it's far and I can complete multiple orders in that time and you get sent out of city center, and you won't get any orders before you get close to the center again, wasting even more time earnings wise. All in all I'm happy, but it could be better\n",

Can you explain McDonald railway station that many of us Wolt Budde has attached our bags on our bikes scooters and cars, There is only one particular employee who in the McDonald railway station who refuses to hand out the order before hair out and pick up his attached bag and it takes time, there is a box -made of 8 steps from the counter where you get the food for your bike where you get the order in the bag.

Only thing I could correct was the beverage, as I could see it was wrong compared to the order in the app, which I pointed out. Generally I cannot always, as a courier, check the food, because often times it’s placed in a sealed food bag by the restaurant. So out of respect for the customers, I don’t break the seal to check what’s inside. So I have to trust the restaurant staff when receiving an order. I would recommend Wolt to make the restaurants either always tape the receipt of the food content on the bags or hand the receipt over to the courier to be sure the food is correct. There are many young service employees in this area who works in restaurants, and they are not always that observant and precise with the orders. Would be great if you could encourage them to double check the orders and consistently use receipts on the bags. Because it’s us as couriers that has to deal with upset customers when we drive a far distance to deliver a wrong order. Thanks in advance for understanding.\n",

Spending periods without an order just to get bundles out of the blue. Revert back. This is bad for couriers and customers!!! It will come to Wolt as the company if things don't improve\n",

I’ve written this before and I know you probably don’t care, but just know the matter has been brought to your attention many times… also when doing bundles/ triples.

If I checked them all, I can't complete the task. 2. The prices of the tasks are too low. There is no account of the waiting time at wolt market, you should be able to get an estimate of the waiting time. I got 36 dkk for a second order from wolt that had to wait 15 minutes and took me 10 minutes to deliver...too little! I am not taking more bundled order unless they are ready at the assignment.\n",

There are only 2 hours each day with enough order for a fair hourly wage. It is not enough for us to compensate the other horribly quiet hours.

Everyone’s going online at 17:00 in the weekends now lol, I’m earning more outside of the bonus hours. Don’t start more new couriers, this Sunday was really slow between 17-20, while we’re only 1 week into April month. When is it time for a pay rise? Pay has decreased per task since 2022, although inflation has been high. I was even told by support that we would not receive less than 35DKK per task.. All other groups in Denmark receive yearly pay increases. Why does everyone else get more money, but not us Wolt Courier Partners? Not even the smallest adjustment.\n",

I find a number of times that customers on site are prioritized, rather than Couriers who are politely waiting for orders .. Ask Burger King on Ellebjergvej 142 (Valby Syd) to remember to mark orders ready, have experienced a number of times standing and waiting a long time just to discover that the order has been ready for a long time', 'Dear Wolt support, I would like to file another complaint against McDonalds Kongens Nytorv. They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\"]"

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

However there is a general problem with some of the larger and smaller restaurants pushing the “order is ready”, while in reality we end up waiting 5-15 minutes for the order. Especially Hubbs Kitchen, both Frederiksberg and Nordvestare some of the biggest ones in this. As couriers we miss out reaching boost goals, when we are kept waiting, two Hubbs orders can destroy the tarvet of reaching 12 orders before 20.00.\n",

      "3. Hello I still observe that as an available courier in the area of Ørestads I bearly get any orders from Mcdonalds Field's or KFC Field's, seeing that priority is given especially to cars coming from far away. Just consider that for the reasonable share of orders I should receive as a constant available courier of the area, distance payment could be saved from your side, for the orders I could reasonably receive from such places. But the algorithm prefers to pay distance 90% of the time, as I have long observed. This issue I have observed it since september of last year, here in Ørestads. Please, check if you may, my history of tasks performed until such date and you will see that as a constant available courier of Ørestads, my history of orders was full of Mcdonald's Fields (the most) and KFC Field's, Shawarma Ørestads aswell....but not now. Just don't overlook the distance payment you were saving on such orders by being assigned to regular couriers of the area like my case, and that for some reason related to the algorithm (I guess) is not the case now, and only cars coming from further distance do get priority. As an example, I could literally be next to or inside such restaurants waiting for orders for 1 hour or more (not exagerating) watching how car drivers especially come and go with orders, ignoring my availability. It is simply something not coherent from the algorithm in my opinion, and it would mainly be beneficial for Wolt in order to pay less distance fees, by the algorithm not skipping available couriers in the area Sincerely, Juan\n",
      "4. The operations team are absolute idiots... Ive got two order for the same building. The first order paid 121kr for 3.7km. And the second one paid 74kr for 4km. The had the same amount of weight and it was in the same building. Both before peak hours. Great job idiots!\n",

      "10. Hello with you \"Wolt\" I will start by mentioning that I have been very happy with my time at Wolt and proud to tell how well we serve, as today is called how well we used to and earn, because that time is over. You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you put our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing, such as praying at Islands Brygge, birds distance of 450 meters above the water when reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km can give 21.50,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Which is some hell of a swine, personally I reject all orders for less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out and made up to 3 times have je Experienced, as us Kure who is left I can reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results. Give and it comes back, stingy and you get smack. !!\n",

      "1. hello It is necessary to say two things here. 1- On rainy and cold days and after sunset the stated prices for delivery do not differ from hot summer days, which is very problematic considering that under heavy rain, the delivery work is really difficult, especially with a motorcycle that is directly exposed to the rain and we spray water from the side of the cars, it will be very difficult so we have to reject some orders. 2- Burger King Vanløse has a problem with the beverage package, and almost all orders including the drinks have waste or leaks that need to be warned because it is us who are questioned when the food is delivered.\n",
      "2. When you deliver and accept orders, I would think it would make it much easier for the driver if you could see what the order consisted of before accepting it. For example, if I accept an order then it says what food it is so if I want to take 2 orders at once then I know if I have room for it in my bag or not. Right now it's just a rate to take 2 because you don't know if you have space\n",
      "3. You are so irresponsible with your workers. You have to be respect. You send people to pick up food from Wolt market and you know that everyone can come to do that, but of course a bike or motorcycle can't do dlthat, it has to be a car because is too many bags. Last time I went to pick it up I went down with mi bike, I tried to cancel the task and you told me it was too late. So please be respectful with workers. We are humans.\n",

Can you explain McDonald railway station that many of us Wolt Budde has attached our bags on our bikes scooters and cars, There is only one particular employee who in the McDonald railway station who refuses to hand out the order before hair out and pick up his attached bag and it takes time, there is a box -made of 8 steps from the counter where you get the food for your bike where you get the order in the bag. It is only this one employee that does it and it is only this one McDonald it happens by. Please explain the manager who both order gets cold and it is frustrating to have driven all the way there and then not get the order.\n",
      "6. The Coca Cola from McDonald's was not sealed and it was spilled all over and the customer couldn't enjoy his drink. There was also a lot of waiting time on some places to pick up the orders but it's okay. Besides that it was good.\n",
      "7. Ift. The app. It could be nice if you could see all the orders you have to pick up from the same restaurant at once, so you don't have to take one in the bag first, swipe picked up (maybe even on the way out the door), and only then find out that you have to pick up one more.\n",
      "8. Over some time I’ve noticed some room for improvement for McDonald’s. First, the cups are not sealed good enough. Often the soft drinks spill in the bag, eventhough i try to drive carefully (bike), and make the inside of the bag wet and sticky. Secondly, often (not always) the staff don’t seem to pay attention to Wolt couriers. Often eventhough the order is ready, they don’t reach out to me when I enter the restaurant and go to the counter. I know they are busy but when i stand in front of the counter with my big blue bag, they should pay attention at least within a minute or two. I don’t want to disturb their work, but sometimes I have to call across the counter after many minutes without them realizing I’m here.\n",

      "1. However, I would like to file a formal complaint about the Wolt staff in the Wolt Market Willemoesgade. They are extremely hard in their tone and it is as if they have formed their own little click, they shout and almost stand 3-4 people at once and shout one in your head when you are up there and pick up orders. It is a direct unpleasant environment and only the English -speaking ladies are in there is the problem. I reject the decided order up there from because of the unpleasant mood you meet as soon as you come in the door, it is primarily in the evening they are there. It destroys your entire work ethic when you come in and meet these women. I would like to be taken seriously here as their shouting and extremely condescending saying to me as cure commandments is simply under all criticism. Especially a blonde and one that is shown from India or something. We are some messes that are extremely tired of it but now I write the message as the other messages cannot write properly English or Danish. Would you not want to help us with those who work in the Wolt Market Willemoesgade in Aarhus. It's not a good situtation that is up there and it ruins our daily lives.\n",

INCREASE THIS PRICES .. make us work with pleasure like before in Wolt Denmark. This is absolutely non - respectable and valued job! Day by day … less and less wishes to work. I repeat few many times .. is not put billboards in hole city to make fake advertising (how u gonna earn more then 200kr/h ) . Invest in the ppl who are long with the company and especially ppl by car because without us … WOLT IS losted !\n",

If I look at Silkeborg, Herning, Holstebro then there is busy or normal. Now not answer that I can just drive to Holstebro? Turn of more than 100km return. Another thing that wonders me, today I started at 5:29 pm at DK Pizza and Grill Viborg and I stood alone Wolt man with 5 men with Foodora bags and got orders, then pizza the man asks a foodora man if the order he should have is a wolt order ??? What's going on ?? Greetings Henrik\n",
      "4. Why are you asking for feedback?! You setted up the algorithm to lower the payment per task until it became almost not motivating anymore to work with wolt. You are continuing to push the so called VARIABLE METHOD OF PAYMENT which is absurd and actually is a tricky way to lower the income for us and higher it for you. I couldn't believe it here in Denmark the sistem allow you to play around with those who do the work, instead to appreciate it and pay always better... We feel like real slaves...\n",

(Continuation of my previous message as I sent it a bit too early)… The kind of discrimination faced by us Wolt couriers in Mc Donalds in Hillerød is unacceptable and almost criminal by law. I hope you can align with them a more appropriate way to treat the couriers and to not down-prioritizing our food, so it’s always late for our customers. Further more please pay attention to Wolt couriers that are stealing food from the restaurants and take the necessary actions to stop it from happening continuously, so that the better behaved Wolt couriers can have a better collaboration with the restaurants.

      "1. Time waste. Too much emphasis on bundles. That's why a lot of orders were late(bad for customers). Because of this couriers weren't getting orders in a fluid manner. Spending periods without an order just to get bundles out of the blue. Revert back. This is bad for couriers and customers!!! It will come to Wolt as the company if things don't improve\n",

      "3. Hi Wolt Support, I wanted to share some feedback and a suggestion that could really improve the experience for couriers like me. It would be great if the app could show us the order items before we accept the delivery. That way, if my bag is almost full and the order is small, I can accept it. But if it’s a larger order, I can leave it for another Wolt courier with more space (or someone with a car). Also, I want to say a big thank you for finally adding the “decline delivery” feature after accidentally accepting an order. I’ve been waiting for that for a long time, and it’s much appreciated! Thanks for considering this suggestion, and keep up the great work! Best regards, Samuele\n",

      "8. Get back to old payment method! It's more clear! Now we don't know, you just se the price that you like for the tasks, really unfair. Km deduction!!!! It doesn't worth it anymore to deliver over 3km. We have to pay 100% of our expenses and the prices are super low. Let the bundles be the full price as before! 35kr for a bundle task over 4km??? When we actually have to drive 1-2-3 km from first drop of to the second??? This is insane\n",
      "9. Please please look at bundle pay, it’s not only about distance. I’ve written this before and I know you probably don’t care, but just know the matter has been brought to your attention many times… also when doing bundles/ triples. Sometimes you deliver one of the orders and get offered a new one, while you still have orders to deliver. BUT THE APP LOOKS LIKE ALL YOUR DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE. This sometimes confuses me so I reject the new orders offered..\n",
      "10. I got a survey earlier today where I said I felt the payment was fine. However on busy days like today, and snowy weather, where you're held up in ultra slow traffic, the tasks could pay better. Especially the bundles fees, as arriving to the venues and customers take extra long time in these weather conditions. Otherwise all is good!\n",

      "1. The new nighttime bonus is absolutely atrocious and disrespectful. 10% extra is NOTHING. Maybe 30-40% would be a realistic number. Normal workplaces give 1,5x more (+50%) for night shift workers. I would really like to work at night sometimes, but this so called bonus is just not worth it. I hope you will reconsider your approach and start treating courier PARTNERS as actual partners and not as company slaves\n",
      "2. Today was a very disappointed day, first you put the booster from 25 to 20% and try to sale a ideia of a mistake, typo, come on, we are not stupid. After this I made 25 deliveries and was supposed to be the big day bla bla bla, and with 25 deliveries I made not so different if I compare with 31/12, when I made 26 deliveries more the 1.300, today with 25 I made less than 1.300! For me we were cheated! Very disappointed and sad about.\n",
      "3. Really ridiculous in putting boost on Friday between 18.00 and 20.00 when absolutely nothing happens !! Have dear 3 trips during that period and it was! Uses a lot of gasoline to lie down and run around by order. It's really bad style\n",
      "4. It raihed all day where is the bonus for bad weather\n",
      "5. Overall, I'm happy with my collaboration with Wolt, but there's one problem. The new courier registered using my referral number and made 30 deliveries in 30 days, starting with the first delivery. But I still haven't received the 1000 CZK referral bonus that I was entitled to. On July 22, I contacted Wolt support to find out why I was not credited with the referral bonus, but I still have not received an answer to my question. So for now I give the Wolt app 2 stars.\n",
      "6. You have to give more wages and give holiday money\n",
      "7. wolt is a crap company, during the bonus you don't get any orders, fuck you\n",
      "8. I suggest you pay more hours bonus on weekends and when the weather is really bad like yesterday in Copenhagen.\n",
      "9. How can I have made less money than in everyday life despite more order and weekend bonus ?????\n",
      "10. When is raining you should pay more or bonus otherwise we can't get wet and the delivery won't be able and all the food will stay in restaurants. Thinks about it. Thanks\n",

Each time i sent the form and still it repeated again, and especially that i don't have a direct communication channel to them and it gas to be via the support- so I'm not happy. I sk pls that someone from the operational team contact me at 29900570 or send me an email to dalitv@gmail.com telling me when they will sent a new invoice with the added fee plus to see this trouble doesn't appears again . Thanks alot\n",

      "4. I have been suspended for an order even though I have neither picked up or delivered the order. It is about order number 896, the task was canceled before I managed to pick it up. I took the task to start with but wrote to you again that you have to cancel it and it was. So I didn't pick it up from the restaurant. When I wrote yes to one of your colleagues on message then it had gone strong and I read wrong. You can contact the restaurant and hear them if I picked up the order or not. I only picked up two orders from there and they were delivered to the customers.\n",
      "5. Very bad support i waited 1 hour and the order canceled for system fail i said make new one and I took only 35 1 hour 35 krone perfect deal\n",
      "6. So bad i go to restaurant and the order cancel it’s not my fault and it’s not pay for me i think we think we must look for another company better because wolt company became bad treatment of her employees thanks for everything\n",
      "7. Hi, I think it has been complicated to contact support about problems. I was at a restaurant that marked his order ready about 15 minutes before they actually were. I wrote this for support so this could be noted in the restaurant's history as I know they are contacted if their order is often too late. When the person in support returns, they write \"What can I help with\". I am out and running, so I do not have the opportunity to repeat what can already be read.\n",
      "8. wolt is designed to steal from us, couriers, yesterday I worked all day for wolt and at the last order the location where I picked up gave me the wrong order, I know it's within my competence to check but many locations don't even give a receipt , the order was worth 37 crowns and they stopped me 230 for around six delivered work orders\n",
      "9. Even though i delivered the food which was partly wasted, im still being fully charged. I think couriers that work hard and are sincere, Shouldn't be charged for their mistake - it can happen to anybody\n",
      "10. Arrived to pick up the order and the order was already taken. Support contacts the venue and got them to do the order again, only that they didn't agree cause they remade it twice so what was handled by support on the phone? Nothing. I then got the task removed and at least got 35 kr for it. Only it's bonus hours and should be around 50 but support tells me bonus is not really a thing, which it's not true cause I can clearly see I get around 45 instead of 35 on weekends so bonus is definitely still a thing. So I wasted over 40 minutes for....35 kr. I'm sorry but no. Very bad support. Not okay.\n",

      "1. I would like to arrange for delivery.\n",
      "2. Yesterday I had an order from Wolt Market and there was 6 bags and for that it would be needed 2 couriers. I was waiting for over 15 min to be ready and then decided to ask them about it because is not really usual to be that late. For my surprise they told me that only one of the couriers get the notification that is ready which for me make no sense. Could you please inform that to the IT team so that can be fixed otherwise the customer will receive an order within 10min and the rest who knows when?\n",
      "3. I took an order that was almost an hour late, i get there and am told that somebody took the order already. Support tells mr i can wait for a remake. I wait for a remake and deliver it. This ordeal takes 30minutes on top of delivering - but according to your guidelines ( as i am told by the support ) this is not worthy of a compensation. So this tells me, that next time there is a problem with an order, abandon it instantly so i can use my time to actually work and deliver normal orders, and let you deal with the customer. Absolutely horrible , especially with the overly cheery attitude claiming they care but in reality couldnt care less about couriers\n",
      "4. Meny is not marking heavily orders as heavy and unfortunately they started once first after 5 minutes asking to pack the back - therefore I was delayed. The staff there seems to be unmotivated as they had to call even the person who has to pack for Wolt. And they said that they start the task always first when the driver is there - which is of course not the fact. Guess it was the todays staff and a friendly reminder helps\n",

      "6. Hi, I had an experience tonight that was a bit strange. I accepted a task that was going from the center of Aarhus to Hasselager, the distance was 10km, I received the opportunity to take another order. The next order would first be ready for pickup in 20 minutes, it had to be delivered to the same road, but gave only 30 kr. When an extra order is going on a very long trip, but you only get so little paid, then there is very little to reject the order. If I had been offered 70 kr, I would like to expect the time and Wolt would save the money they now have to pay another bid to deliver the food.\n",

      "10. Especially when you are on a bike, it is really nice to be able to see the content, and thus also the size, of the orders you are on your way to pick up. Therefore, it does not seem quite optimal that you have removed the overview of the content of the orders from the Wolt Market. They are often quite large and heavy to cycle with. Now you really do not have the opportunity to see the order until it is handed over to one. Before, you could assess the size of the order and possibly get it canceled, without having to run in vain.\n",

At the reception they reject me because the address was different and they don t have a name of the customer. I call the customer but they didn t answer me. I was outside with 2 packages, their one was like 10kg and started to rain, heavy rain... and i put the package inside the box again. I contacted the support but with all the water and the time i lose 40 minutes. Later the support give me a correct number, a third one. And they confirm that the hotel was correct. So I lose time, energy and make problems with 2 deliveries. I just want to ask you to do two things. Make a blacklist and check the number of the customers or force them to put the name of the hotel and the relative name of the booking in that hotel. So if the customer is from an hotel I can easily pass the reception with correct data. And the customer after 3 hours, while I was sleeping they call me. So i would like to propose a black list for the hotel and these couple of customers. The hotel was Axel guldsmeden hotels, they have 2 address front and back door. They weren t collaborative. Even if I show them the address of the backdoor they insist that the name of the customer was the hotel, another place. Secondly the customer, i don t care if they were tired or lazy, they used the wrong name in the hotel, they didn t give me the name pf the hotel, they give me the backdoor, the phone was wrong. And they call me during the night. I SPENT 1 hour in the night, under rain for some banana and idk. So please make a black list or make a procedure to force the customer to don t be retarded. Next time I will spend 10 or 15 minuts after this I will consider lose the delivery. No one pay me if I get sick or If the customer don t answer. I am trying to be professional but I don t like to lose my energy and time. So I repeat put the hotel on a black list because they werent collaborative. If they were more open I can save 20 minutes and avoid to stay under a heavy rain with an heavy bag.\n",

She waxs first impolite by calling me with unfriendly vibes, not saying her name while I'm biking( delivering bundle of 4 orders ) telling me to answer her msg. Obviously I didn't see it as I was biking to the customers. 2. All her way of communicating was make wrong , insisting again & again that I marked the order as delivered and didn't pay attention that I did. If I got it to deliver -i would just bike to the customer to deliver it. I'm very much in present time and read all the data in the tasks i get. After I picked up from Doner King I instantly got an order from Del nono. 3. I asked her how long she works on Wolt and you she didn't want to answer. If she would worked enough she would know that the system can do flubs. She chose to blame the courier and it's not ok. I work 4 years in Wolt. I'm 99.9,% sure she is not danish. As the Danish supporters are kind friendly and have caring attitude to the couriers. She would also know that a courier can get an order as part of a bundle and then doesn't get in the app to deliver it , he would call support and told they don't see it in the system. So the system can make a mistake and could be that what happened on that case -a mistake of the system. Even if the drop off is very short distance , from experience -the app won't let me to swipe it as delivered after bust picking it up. I find herway of communicating an unpleasant one. Pls make sure to have foreign supporters that really give a supportive attitude to the courier ad it's give not a good PR to Wolt BR Dalit\n",

We find that we received a task from Burger King at 3 o'clock at night approx. We drive out to Burger King and Burger King was closed at the time. An addition to the app could be smart if you have more orders on the trip that you can sort who you first run out to the direction on the road. (Unless it's hot food so it's first priority) I was thinking about whether you could raise delivery the price a little?

I believe when the app shows the customer's location before pick-up, and there is another order that can be picked up right after, the app will show the wrong customer's location (it shows the second one) until I decline the second order after confirming the pick up of the first one.\n",
      "3. The new system doesn't work the app finally said the right km we make but the payment is less, all the promotion about the new system make it simple for us the earnings and how to get what we had asked for so long, a way to accurate more the route, but was smoke because many courier we don't understands the new pricing model and to get the accuracy for the route it cost us almost 20kr or 30kr per task just to see on the app what we knew that we drive more km than what we get pay, just that now we get even less pay. I hope we can have better conditions soon. And the wolt support, they have not fault on all this but the handle our insecurity and frustration on this situation but they have no answers for our questions and they don't give help as they did with the last model\n",

I’ve written this before and I know you probably don’t care, but just know the matter has been brought to your attention many times… also when doing bundles/ triples. Sometimes you deliver one of the orders and get offered a new one, while you still have orders to deliver. BUT THE APP LOOKS LIKE ALL YOUR DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE. This sometimes confuses me so I reject the new orders offered..\n",
      "6. The app has been a DISASTER these last 3 days. It stops working for 5 to 15 minutes at a time. It did so like 5 times.

Is anyone gonna pay me for all the lost time???\n",

We stood and waited for a very, very long time, and in the end we go in and ask if they are not kind to take Wolt orders, and in addition he answers he comes over in a little while. But they just continued in the same track of handling orders in the store, and only after a long time does he come over, maybe because we went in to ask again. They tell us nothing about when they will service us or how long it will take before we get our orders handed out - they just keep the hatch closed. It is rude and not at all okay. At times, it seems that they are waiting for a lot of orders to accumulate and that there are a lot of cures outside before they start responding to orders already marked ready. It is an unpleasant situation for us cures because we are going to wait for far too long and without anyone giving us information about what is happening.

      "5. Wolt should atop blocking the \"accwpt order button\" with review requests for the staff. That is a forced sabotage. Also, Wolt should consider that if an order needs to be delivered in areas of the city that are very far away from hotspots, the order needs to be paid double. If I go 3-4 kilometers in the outskirts of the city to deliver food where there are barely any restaurants I then need to also return back to the areas that have restaurants but I find myself biking many kilometers back to thr hotspot areas on my own wasted energy and with no pay. Wolt needs to acknowledge hotspots on the map abd integrate them in the app itself and calibrate the payment of orders based on how far away from hotspots a courier gets sent.\n",

Can mention, I've talked to many cures showing huge dissatisfaction with the new payment system. You dare not even show details of payment, which we got in the old system.

I look up and see him just walk past me and I ask \"What's Up\" but he doesn't answer and just goes on. I look up at the girls behind the counter, which tells me that \"I shouldn't take care of it - that's how he is just sometimes\"! So they have seen what happened. I am a little in shock and deep, deeply amazed as I get no explanation from him. I think any of the girls say it has something to do with the door. Their door does not close properly in behind one because it gets stuck in their mat which is not level, but it may not be near to be a valid reason to hit me hard in the back twice with the knots without being prepared for it in any way. I now hurt the muscle around my shoulder blade, and stopped working today because it hurt. I use that muscle a lot when driving a car when I lift the bag up stairs, etc. - I use it a lot at work. My question now is what you want to do? Want to have a really serious talk with Iki Sushi Nordre Frihavnsgade, and the person who struck me, or what's going to happen from here? Are they going to pay for my physical and medical treatment due to the pain I have in the muscle now that reduces my ability to work or what's going to happen?

Even if u give extra fee it will still not compensate if they get sick or enjure. Im one of the crazy partners who does not get effected my this weather. Well to be honest im just Human eventually i will get enjure or sick. I alrdy Solved this problem. Simple math everyone can understand. 1+1=2 and 2+2= 4. 1 car. 2 partners = 2 bundles = 4 happy costumers. 1 car. 2 accounts link together. Will serve 4 costumers if ur alghorythen is set to it. Dont worry m8 here is the trick. We are going to put ur sale trick into good use in the right way. 1st put a warning sign in ur app. Foreksample: Due to weather comdition the orders will be in motion every one hour to avoid trafick orders so we can deliver fresh food in ur home Thank you for understanding Wolt we care If u have something better go for it. This is just a good brainstorm strategy. Think of the Big picture. Ur giving safety for ur partners at thesame time serving the people everybody wins in this strategy. Also parking Bills is pain in the ass so how do we avoid? I got one idea. We pay ahead. This is mandotory everyone that has a car need to pinch in and pay some amount of fee to avoid Big Bills.

      "8. My guess is the algorithm is a primitive ai, a master manipulator, that waits to offer orders when it’s in your favor, and conversely pushes orders that are in your favor. Just so you know it’s quite stressful to navigate in traffic, and run to the fifth floor and then also try and figure out, if you should accept a bundle or a triple order, even though it seems you are saving Wolt some 10-20 percent compared to normal prices…\n",
      "9. It is very unfortunate how the algorithm significantly continues to keep bicycle drivers \"out of the equation\" in remote areas where there's a McDonalds, like Kastrup or Ørestads. Tonight I have tried to deliver at McDonald's Kastrup since 11'30 in the night until now 2'30. I have only been assigned one order, while car drivers were coming and going with bundles included, as I have been waiting literally inside of the restaurant watching all that time. It is very difficult to assume that all the orders were only suitable for car drivers, unless we admit that the algorithm has developed a remarkable incoherence upon bicycle drivers availability in the mentioned remote areas where there's a McDonalds. I don't know how much Wolt considers such undeniable car-drivers priority in those areas to be long-term efficient at all, when in reality it will lead to the opposite, for many overlooked reasons. It does not make sense at all to skip a courier that is reasonably available in a place where there's a constant flow of tasks like McDonald's. It does not make sense either to assume that all the orders in such a long time-frame were only suitable for car-drivers. It would be easier to win the lottery under the same premises.\n",

      "1. Dear Operations Team As a courier since 2019, this is one of the first times I decide to leave a comment. Your ongoing updates seem to be harming more than benefitting car couriers. We have more expenses than bikes and scooters (having done bike method for two years), and our speed and order size capacity are higher (more in long distance). Therefore, having analyzed this update I conclude to see a decrease of about 20% to 30% in earnings while delivering. Please try to make an incentive for us, and I am not even mentioning the weekend bonus (deleted). I do not participate in protests nor I expected so many changes, just make a fee adjust according to each type of group. Counting “real routes” and pickup distances do not give any meaning when the outcome is a lower return per kilometer made. Please find this message as an encouragement to make real focus on real issues, and to make the game fair to play, for each of the couriers.\n",
      "2. Hello with you \"Wolt\" I will start by mentioning that I have been very happy with my time at Wolt and proud to tell how well we serve, as today is called how well we used to and earn, because that time is over. You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you put our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing, such as praying at Islands Brygge, birds distance of 450 meters above the water when reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km can give 21.50,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Which is some hell of a swine, personally I reject all orders for less than 40,- That is, even one of 39.95,- will be rejected I was offered 26,- for and picking up an order on Sunday in bonus time, +15,- in bonus, = 11,- kr for the order itself? I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results. Give and it comes back, stingy and you get smack. !!\n",

      "4. The bonus doesn't make up for the speed decrease in the snow, still no transparency but likely the only reason it was busy is that there are no drivers, whereas busy normally means you can expect you le orders and short routes as supply and demand kicks in, here it was just very low supply and the routes offered were mostly really bad 4km+ which is exacerbated by the road conditions making those even less worth it than normal. That's not even considering it being cold. I'd love to drive but if it doesn't make sense economically while also being in rougher terring what are we as couriers to do\n",

They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'More than one restaurant marked the order as ready before it was and made me wait.', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

What distance show in the app also doesn’t match with the real road map. This is injustice. You are making money out of US. 2. For long distance order we are not paid sufficiently. According to the single order you are giving ideal amount but while we take long distance order you pay a very poor amount that is truly injustice but you are receiving full delivery charge from the customer and paying your hero’s less. 3. For multiple order you are adding additional amount for the rider but taking full amount from the customer is high was not seen before in wolt. Many of the rider are furious about this changes. We work for you even in the rain, storm or snow. You should pay us accordingly not snitch our hard earned money. Payment should be provided accordingly to the pickup to delivery distance for individual order not like additional distance and you take the full amount paying us on for additional ride. 4. In the worst weather we are not treated or paid respectfully. We deliver with cold, slippery road and always have chances to fall in accidents. In those case you should increase or boost the payment minimum 30% . But what I see you only boost 10% which is not enough, not at all. I hope you will consider those matter and collaborate with us.

Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'More than one restaurant marked the order as ready before it was and made me wait.', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

Distance shown on to the app map got increased after we accept the order but the sad things is we are not getting any payment for additional ride. What distance show in the app also doesn’t match with the real road map. This is injustice. You are making money out of US. 2. For long distance order we are not paid sufficiently. According to the single order you are giving ideal amount but while we take long distance order you pay a very poor amount that is truly injustice but you are receiving full delivery charge from the customer and paying your hero’s less. 3. For multiple order you are adding additional amount for the rider but taking full amount from the customer is high was not seen before in wolt. Many of the rider are furious about this changes. We work for you even in the rain, storm or snow. You should pay us accordingly not snitch our hard earned money. Payment should be provided accordingly to the pickup to delivery distance for individual order not like additional distance and you take the full amount paying us on for additional ride. 4. In the worst weather we are not treated or paid respectfully. We deliver with cold, slippery road and always have chances to fall in accidents. In those case you should increase or boost the payment minimum 30% . But what I see you only boost 10% which is not enough, not at all. I hope you will consider those matter and collaborate with us.

In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

They have no sense of treating us Wolt couriers as human beings and for some reason they refuse to communicate with us properly during pick up. Every other normal venue makes eye contact with the couriers upon entering the venue and informs the courier if the order is ready in 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc. However, at MC Kgn Nytorv they simply ignore us while we stand outside their pickup window and let us wait 20 minutes and one time I waited upwards of 40 minutes for one order. The issue is not the waiting time, the issue is the lack of decency and respect for one another. One evening when it was really cold outside and I had been waiting outside their window I decided to go and wait inside McDonald’s and since there was only one customer waiting and they weren’t busy I asked if I could pick up the order from inside the venue but I was told that it was not possible and had to go back outside to their pick up window as if I was some dog. Another time I will admit there was a friendly staff who let me wait and pick up from inside, but it never happened again since. Today however after being ignored for almost 20 minutes and I finally got the attention of the staff they got angry with me saying they were busy. I simply wanted their attention to ask if the order was going to be delayed another 20 minutes because I had another order in my bag and felt it would not be right for either myself or for the first customer to wait much longer since I didn’t get any response at all. I’m trying to do my work and expect the venues to do their work but because of so many bad experiences with MC Kongens Nytorv I no longer want to accept orders from them and many other couriers I’ve talked to have said the same thing. I sincerely hope that Wolt reaches out to the MC manager and that a solution can be found. For example why doesn’t Wolt give them a penalty fee after -15 minutes and reimburse the courier for waiting in vain? Maybe that will make McDonald’s hire more people during peak hours and weekends. I simply don’t think it’s right that as couriers we’re supposed to wait maybe 20 maybe 40 minutes without pay not knowing how long it’s going to take being completely ignored when simply trying to ask the venue a simple question and they treat us like dogs instead of like human beings communicating to us saying “we are busy, your order will be delayed 30 minutes” because if they did that I could reject the task and deliver the current task already in my bag. But no, they prefer to ignore and let us wait and then get angry at us for trying to do our work. Thank you for reading this and I really do hope a solution can be found between us Wolt couriers and McDonald’s “The original creator of fast food”', 'More than one restaurant marked the order as ready before it was and made me wait.', 'Some restaurants you have to wait a long time, while they say that the food is ready']"

I was the worst possible outcome of a badly pinned adress, o had 0 fault and ended up losing way more that if I ignored the fact that I did an extra km , this is the wrong way of dealing with the workers, next time I'm supposed to ignore it and accept that I'm getting extra distance for 0kr, because if I stop to talk to support I will lose an hour of work? What way I chose I end up losing, I'm so happy to work for a company like this\", 'With a car I earn better with long distances. If the system has a 0.5 km deopoff distance and a 3.9 km one and I am with a car it is very stupid from the system to offer me te 0.5 km first and only offer me the 3.9 km one after I did not accept the 0.5 km one. Very very stupid. And it keeps doing that routinely on other days too.', 'Lots of discrepancies in distance calculation into the app. When we accept an order the distance doesn’t match after accepting the order or our for pickup or delivery. Distance shown on to the app map got increased after we accept the order but the sad things is we are not getting any payment for additional ride. What distance show in the app also doesn’t match with the real road map. This is injustice. You are making money out of US. 2. For long distance order we are not paid sufficiently. According to the single order you are giving ideal amount but while we take long distance order you pay a very poor amount that is truly injustice but you are receiving full delivery charge from the customer and paying your hero’s less. 3. For multiple order you are adding additional amount for the rider but taking full amount from the customer is high was not seen before in wolt. Many of the rider are furious about this changes. We work for you even in the rain, storm or snow. You should pay us accordingly not snitch our hard earned money. Payment should be provided accordingly to the pickup to delivery distance for individual order not like additional distance and you take the full amount paying us on for additional ride. 4. In the worst weather we are not treated or paid respectfully. We deliver with cold, slippery road and always have chances to fall in accidents. In those case you should increase or boost the payment minimum 30% . But what I see you only boost 10% which is not enough, not at all. I hope you will consider those matter and collaborate with us. Together we are a team, without us wolt is nothing. Thanks']"

We have no control of the drinks. It’s a mess. And it takes up so much space. Bundles of 3 are not possible anymore. Don’t get me started on how much extra time it takes for them to pack the bags like this', \"Please do something about the bags. Big procent of the couriers don't use the bags, they just roped them for the bikes and the scooter. Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else.

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did.

But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me.

      "5. Hello with you \"Wolt\" I will start by mentioning that I have been very happy with my time at Wolt and proud to tell how well we serve, as today is called how well we used to and earn, because that time is over. You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you put our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing, such as praying at Islands Brygge, birds distance of 450 meters above the water when reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km can give 21.50,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Which is some hell of a swine, personally I reject all orders for less than 40,- That is, even one of 39.95,- will be rejected I was offered 26,- for and picking up an order on Sunday in bonus time, +15,- in bonus, = 11,- kr for the order itself? I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results. Give and it comes back, stingy and you get smack. !!\n",

      "13. Frankie's is always disrespectful of our role. They just lie abut the orders being ready, the estimated waiting times and they avoid us every time we walk in\n",
      "14. The bonus doesn't make up for the speed decrease in the snow, still no transparency but likely the only reason it was busy is that there are no drivers, whereas busy normally means you can expect you le orders and short routes as supply and demand kicks in, here it was just very low supply and the routes offered were mostly really bad 4km+ which is exacerbated by the road conditions making those even less worth it than normal. That's not even considering it being cold. I'd love to drive but if it doesn't make sense economically while also being in rougher terring what are we as couriers to do\n",

For example, if you are a customer, you can see distance fees.. 1.9 km... as a courier, you get the a 1.9 km distance fee even though from the pick up point you have to drive or bike almost the double. It's the deception of the customer and your courier partner. And it's illegal.\n",

This even though the restaurant was about to have the food ready in the app. I used approx. 15 minutes to wait in the restaurant due to the flawed info in the app. I would like to see compensation as 34kr does not cover that work effort. Otherwise fine :)\n",
      "2. Mc Donald is ignoring couriers. I ve been waiting for 20 minutes after they marked order ready. There are underage children working and they dont give a damn about us waiting there. Every single wolt courier hates mc donald. Please contact them and tell them to change their approach to us and to their responsibilities.. Thank you.\n",
      "3. Is really tired of McDonald's Kongensgade always waiting even if the food is packed and ready for delivery. In addition, it also writes as clear when it is not. Earlier today I waited 40 min. on an order and I asked several times after it. However, this is only Kongensgade and not Storegade, which delivered it immediately.\n",
      "4. Some employees at Macdonalds Havnen in Næstved are extremely rude and disrespectful in their tone and does not seem to have respect for Wolt drivers at all. No importance of our time and self-respect. They treat us like some stupid children…Wolt should take up this matter with the owner soonest. It is your duty to protect us against such rude behavior, disrespect and undue waiting time.....\n",

      "7. Burger King continues to take over half an hour to prepare orders, REGARDLESS of what time of day it is.\n",
      "8. Often it says that the order should be clear but it is not, so you end up standing somewhat longer in the restaurant one expected.\n",
      "9. Otro pizza gothasvej waiter was not nice\n",
      "10. I had an order at McDonald’s that didn’t come in on their system, so I waited 10 minutes before asking if they had it. And when they said it was coming… which it wasn’t. So I waited 5 more minutes and asked again. They then figured out that they didn’t have it. And made it for me. Thankfully everything was worked out in the end. But this did make me 20 minutes late for both of my orders which in turn frustrated my customers…\n",

Gasoline is very expensive and we drive many kilos of meters, even when you drive many kilos of meters, the car loses a lot in value, and when you drive so much you also have to change oil and brakes a little more often. So my opinion is that the car driver can get something more for the trips. And if you work at night, I think it should also give a little extra. But otherwise I think it is good and you do well in relation to support etc\n",

They demand that you take your bag in when you pick up, which means they demand that you remove your bag from the bike with buckles and all, which takes a very long time and is very difficult for the courier. There are no other restaurants in KBH that demand the same from couriers. I also think of people of motorcycles to run their entire setup because Frankies makes this demand.\n",
      "11. I forgot to come with feedback after my guard so here it is. I once again had 2 bad experiences with packaging that were not close. This provides an extremely bad experience for the customer. As a bid, this is clearly what I see as the biggest problem and I would advise you to go in and make demands on the restaurants regarding the packaging. You could even make your own packaging that the restaurants can buy. It is alpha-omega that all containers are hamitically closed and can withstand tilt or even stand upside down if it ends like that. If it makes the packaging more expensive then it is good that there is a statutory charge and the restaurants can even make a mortgage system so that customers can come back with the packaging and get money back (when they have to pick up food Aha, win win). Of course, it will require the packaging to be reusable, but it is just positive for the environment and the business.\n",

Wolt should monitor whether couriers use their bags at pickups and dropoffs, because let me tell you, 80% of them don’t, which goes against our contract and against basic health code regulations.

For a planned route to work, it must bring us some cash for the time being on it, which 75kr for 3 tasks doesn't bring, and neither is anything that's less than 130kr. In pick time isn't worth a planned route i rather do 3 for 50kr than a planned route of 3 orders with 120kr even if i need to wait for those 3 tasks of 50kr maybe the same time like i would have been on the planned order\n",

I had three people standing in front of a hotel today waiting for different things and I have to trust people’s names are what they say they are etc. I also canceled the third pick up as it was awkward I didn’t know how big and heavy it was going to be as I usually avoid pickups from wolt market, and it was in the wrong direction before going to my drop off. I already had KFC and McDonalfs orders. This left one poor lady standing there confused waiting for her giffler and I assured her someone else was coming with the order. The thing is that bundles are basically just the same orders but all at once and the routing especially in the middle of town on a Friday evening when people are cycling drunk going through red lights etc mean riders WILL cancel orders.\n",

Anton from Wolt has to go to school again, because it seemed like the times that were not bonus was very busy, while in the bonus time there were not many deliveries. Sunday night after 8 pm in KBH things went completely wrong and it requires L strongly to evaluate how to put bonus time on. For more messes you think you are laughing and it must cost you a lot with all the orders not delivered.\n",

This other notification arrived too late.\n",

      "17. First you changed the new year bonus from 25% to 20% and told everyone it was a mistake that you wrote 25% from the beginning. You don’t make the same mistake two-three times. I’m sorry but I don’t buy it. And then you promised 50% between 16-20 but we didn’t get it. We delivered the same amount of orders as usual and made the same amount of money in the same time. When we compare the amount we earned on one delivery today and on other days it is almost the same… I’m very disappointed with this. How are we supposed to believe you when you straight up lie to us? I do not trust you anymore and I for sure won’t deliver on the 1st of January again if this is how you do it… Three years ago I worked on the 1st of January for you and made 2250 in six hours. That’s double the amount that I made today …\n",

      "19. This app is so bad, I can't believe wolt really paid dev to make and check it. Venus like Mcdonald and Burgerking are fully with stupid people that are not capable to take care of orders, not even capable to talk to you. They prefer to leave you wait for 15 minutes even if the order already done ,I see the order , the order can see me too but between us might be a retard who don't even know why he is working in burger king . Maybe I'm a little too mean, or maybe not. Take it with break mother×××××. If I would made the app, I would add the bonuses separately. So in a rainy day or bad weather when you get bonus, to be able to see it separately in another box or next to your income. So you can really see what bonus you get and therefore people won't text 100000000 messages to wolt support asking why there is no bonus on top . Many things can be improved in order to earn more as wolt company and also wolt worker, but in the end I'm just a simple courier who is kinda sad that I'm going down instead of up, especially because all my experience.\n",
      "20. The new nighttime bonus is absolutely atrocious and disrespectful. 10% extra is NOTHING. Maybe 30-40% would be a realistic number. Normal workplaces give 1,5x more (+50%) for night shift workers. I would really like to work at night sometimes, but this so called bonus is just not worth it. I hope you will reconsider your approach and start treating courier PARTNERS as actual partners and nog as company slaves\n",

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay.

         "[\"The world's bad wolt guard. It requires a little elaboration, because I hope I never repeat. You write out that you expect higher demand than usual this evening - quite fair. It also goes well for the first hour and earns DKK 250 but then I bump into a restaurant where I wait 15 min for the food. It is slavish, but can happen. My next order is already -15 min but I take it and then ask the staff how long they expect. She says 2 min and it's super. It goes 10 min and when I ask again they say a maximum of 7 min. Since I have stood a total of 25 min, they discover that the food has not been made at all and asks me to take another order. I am writing for support that will not take me off the job because the restaurant has to report the order as canceled - fair enough. But the short and long thing is that the restart does not control a shit and does not cancel the order, so I stand for 10 minutes further and support does not take care of me. As support finally gets confirmation on the orders must be canceled, another 5-10 min before support just returns to me to take the order of the order. So I have now spent 45 minutes on a job that did not lead to anything. Support writes so they compensate me, but then get a mere 35 kr. The EC juices for rings for 45 min frustrating downtime. To return to the start. You encourage us to go online because it gets busy, but then you end up just standing and glowing. You should probably tighten up with your partner restaurant having control over its shit. Of course, they are mega busy one day like today, but then they have to spend a longer hour on how long the food takes to make. So how hard it can be. This is a problem that always happens on holidays, but why is nothing done about it? I had probably hoped to work for many hours and earn a good salary, but then it ended up I have to go off line because I don't have a fucking confidence that you are in control of your partner restaurants can live just in time\", \"For the most part, these are good trips to restaurants and customers and most customers are happy when we come up with their food. It's mostly in the evening they get a little sour as we start to get pressed, those of us who are still online to receive orders. Now I do not know how many wolts cure there is here in Viborg but it is as if from 8 pm we are only 2-3 pieces to dispose of the deliveries there are. The fact that you do not have a zone you have to be in to be able to go online It is really nice for then you can be at home and be online and then leave from there when you get an order The very time estimates about when to start your delivery could be a little longer, eg 30 seconds instead of 5 seconds, because if you now swipe for delivered and you are on the 4th floor somewhere and you have one more delivery, then it will take some time before you reach your bike or car before you can actually move on to the next customer. In terms of the online times for where people can order food at could possibly change on Friday and Saturday until 11 pm as an experiment and then see if there are orders there and whether the WOLT employees will run there. I myself would at least want to try it as an experiment as I have experienced several times that there have been orders that mean that I have first delivered the last order around 22: 30-35. All in all, it's really good to drive for Wolt and I love it The employees are really good at helping when you need it 1 Things I would like to imagine is: That you could switch around between the cities that are around your own hometown If you now happened to be in another city, then you could go online there and see if you could earn a little there, even if you were not in your own hometown That was all for now. Hope you get a read and possibly think about whether the ideas I have described can be used. Mvh Mogens Thomsen (a happy employee)\", 'This is a copy of what I send in every day. I have been doing Wolt for 3 years almost all the way 7 days a week. Here\\'s so my story Hello with you \"Wolt\" I will start by mentioning that I have been very happy with my time at Wolt and proud to tell how well we serve, as today is called how well we used to and earn, because that time is over. You talk about listening to us cures and fairly done the app. First you put our starting fee down from 45,- to 35,- earlier it was a bird spacing, such as praying at Islands Brygge, birds distance of 450 meters above the water when reality was 2 km. Ñu has once again fixed the app in favor of Wolt and not us who have made you rich. In the video on YouTube, the guy tells us that you have listened to us, but that is not entirely correct or you have misunderstood something. Now you have again changed the app in favor of Wolt, so a delivery that is in fact 5 km can give 21.50,- as it is a delivery close to the previous one and not as before, both order from start to finish. Which is some hell of a swine, personally I reject all orders for less than 35,- That is, even one of 34.95,- will be rejected I am super disappointed with your behavior against us. There are also a large number of colleagues who have stopped and it can be clearly felt how busy it has become. Many orders are thrown out and made up to 3 times I have experienced, as us cures who are left can not reach and pick up in time as you replace/pay. 100% even owed \"Wolt\" Presence never gives good results. Give and it comes back, stingy and you get smack. !!']"

Began as courier 5 months ago (it may well be described as relatively new), but today\\'s \"experience\" then gives rise to high blood pressure… I write in in the afternoon (at 16 o\\'clock I think) because I can see in the Wolt App where customers order that they are closed and/or only the possibility of pickup. I ask in the Partner app why there is closed, etc. “There can be many reasons” I am told .. After 20 min. Is the recommendation that I should shut down the app, restart my phone and open the app again. It didn\\'t help. Then she finds out that the city is not open to deliveries .. 25 min. Should it go from I approached ... whether she was able to open it again, or if she got help, I have no idea, but open it was ... but only for a short while. So \"closed\" the city again for delivery .. I have never, until today, experienced this \"phenomenon\" that just shuts down for deliveries. And I wondered when, after all, I was online and drove .. So big is Thisted and the surrounding area, after all .. I did not contact myself again and again got hold of one in the partner support that, like most of the others, must not / can / will inform anything. Whether they had tried to send push messages out to the other couriers, etc. \"Unfortunately, I must not disclose that\" .. What for something ?? Is it so secret that your internal guidelines mean that I, as an active courier, must not know such information? As I wrote in the Partner Support, I wouldn\\'t \"waste\" my time being online if the city is shut down anyway? For how long would go? Would it open again, etc.? No help to pick up .. But I was welcome to call the courier .. I tried it so .. got hold of an English speaker .. who tried to quiet. No one took the phone. The English speaker tried again. No one took the phone. He tried again. I finally came through to a Danish -speaking support that thought it was \"wild\" that her from the partner support had pointed out that I could call in. Since they have no more information on the courier line than they have in the partner support .. Asked him a few questions on the phone and the response was something in the direction of \"now I have to take care I don\\'t tell too much\" .. So .. why all the secret? Why not be open and tell how the situation is. Then I also have a better opportunity to assess whether I should stay online (as well as hold and wait too long for you to press a button that allows people to order food for delivery again) .. It is difficult sometimes to see your act. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to get in touch with a person who can and will help .. The only time I really feel there is help to pick up is if I get an order that I would like to get rid of, as it is far from ready, while I may have a few other orders to lie in the car in the heat/cool the bags .. pretty much everything else does not matter. It\\'s a gossip for a gossip. \"I can\\'t disclose that,\" \"I must not tell,\" \"Our internal guidelines mean that I cannot get closer to this\" .. Amen, it is crazy sometimes .. And no matter how incredible it sounds, I am actually happy to run food out like Wolt Kurer. I am passionate about good service. I am passionate about making people happy and satisfied. But I really miss being greeted right away with the people I turn to to get help. Incidentally, I still miss the answer from both the HR department and the “OPS Team” .. Yes, there are cases .. Yes, there are more from the Partner Support who either move for answers or even created new cases as it should increase the chance of a feedback / response. Why should one case not be enough?', 'Couldn’t deliver the orders because of App', 'Haven’t got my first order yet otherwise app worked well']"

I agree that there is probably a lot cheaper for them, but it really doesn't work. The cups overturn in the bag and the lid is not super dense, so soda is wasted into the bag. And it is almost consistent that it happens. And it's not just because I throw around with the bag and turn it in different ways all the time. No, I really try to keep it as straight and quiet as I can at all, but there really is nothing to do before they overturn and waste. And it goes beyond the customer who gets less soda than what they have ordered, and it goes beyond me, which has to wipe the bag after the soda that has been wasted. So this is a small boon for these places to find a better way to store soda for takeaway than cardboard cups; Because it really doesn't work. I hope they find a better solution soon.\", 'Some fast food joints should start packing drinks better, it’s not a big issue, but the drinks are dripping, and the acid from the soda damages the bag, which we have to pay ourselves. Also, customers might think the drink is spilled if they see some drops running down the cups. Burger King, Carl Jr’s and a few other ones. In other countries a layer of plastic is put on the drinks. Also. It’s been pretty quiet. Please don’t hire too many couriers.', \"McDonald's needs to have better cup holders. They're so unstable, even if I put the drinks to the back of the bag and press the meal against it to wedge it in, when I accelerate, due to the contents of the delivery bag shifting, the drink topples.

I contacted wolt support and got help by i supporter name ZORA. I took the time explaining the whole error and she told me to drive over at the costumers right location which was nearly another 2km. And that I would be compensated. I of course cycled the extra two miles with another order in the bag.. ( yes I picked another order before I arrived to nørrebrogade 5, where I noticed the fault. The second task was bundle pick up and was further away south from Nørrebrogade 5. And I had to ride an additional 2 km north) Wheb delivering the order, i made the costumer aware that he wrote he\\'s adresse wrong and that he should write hes adresse correctly right away.. Seconds later i contacted ZORA again and said that the task was delivered now.- And to my suprise I was only compensated 28dkk.. I didn\\'t expected being compensated so low. Not only did I use almost 15min contacting the costumer and wolt support. I cycled almost an extra 2 km. Plus, I now had a longer travel to the second task that I needed to deliver. But ZORA said that there was nothing she could do and that it was automatically calculated compensation. That was I total waste of time/ earnings. I have had sane scenarios like these before where I got compensate much much better than this time. This time was even more challenging and I only got compensated with 28dkk. That was absolutely disappointing.. I was told \"if I could\" cycle to the right location. And that I would be compensated. Next time support should mention how much the compensation would be before we do the extra work.... Another bad experience happened to me as well was about 7:40pm I got hit by I car. It happen after I took a task and cycled over the the restaurant that I got hit at h.c.andersen Boulevard by vehicle. Nothing happened to serious. My bike is a bit jacked up. I was I dialog with the driver who hit me and I got he\\'s contact info. I contacted wolt support again and wrote that I need to have my task removed because I got hit by a car.. there was no answer.. I wrote again that I got hit by a vehicle and wrote where I can report my accident.. couple of few minutes later I see that my task was removed with no answer. And that the chat ended. ?

It is not my problem, it should be an insurance case as all parties are people and can make mistakes. One must not have a smaller year behind the box, that is what happens, again not my problem, but this illegal act should not cost me. I am so frustrated with this that I have gone offline because of it, it may not be true that I have been at work 1 full hour to get 30 kr which is based on someone else's mistake. The supporter who made this decision has for some reason no logical sense, which is worrying as they are between the lead between us and the customers. She asked me to hand over the food to the customer even though it was not the right order, where after she asked if I could drive it to the restaurant and pick up the right orders like that about 3-4 min after she wrote I had to hand in. After this I had written that it was too late when she said she will have to deduct full amount from as both parties are responsible for this error. Which I don't think was the case here if the staff of the restaurant gives me the order where the staff directly look at the number and still manage to give me the wrong order is not my mistake. I've never seen anything like it. I hope you get control of your staff This is not okay. I think it is rude to send a bid for an hour of work without pay. Good evening hope you get control of your policies (not to support illegalities as children behind the box)\", 'I had an Incident with an order that I got, I went to the address but the girl told me she did not order any but the address is hers, and I asked her if may be her husband and her boyfriend ordered it she was so sure no one did. One of your support team texted me As i was delivered the other order amd we had a good conversation and decided to return to the address and try one more time if not i will return it to the super market. But suddenly one of your support team his name was Mads came and \" ORDERED \" and even told me he is going to deduct if I didnot delivered it and he was so sure that I went to a wrong address and tried to blame me. By the way I went back to the address and tried one more but the home owner refused to open and even told me she is gonna call the police and I told him and he gave the phone number the when I called the customer said that she had made a mistake she wrote her old address which is not hers now cause she is being moved to another house. But Mads tried to be sorry after he said alot and even blame me and treathened me. But I dont accept his apologise even Told him how it cost me his attitude and make me up set and over all my precious time.']"

Because of that all bags are really damaged and they can't be closed. So the couriers deliver the food with open bag. Today i saw a courier delivering without any bag, and another one who use a sport bag. This is not acceptable. Few days ago I ordered a ramen from Ramen to birru and the guy showed to my door without bag and holding my soup in his hands outside is very cold. The soup was very cold, I think he didn't use a bag in his car. I sent complain about that. You should tell to all pick up places to ask for bag, before they give the food.\", \"Using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items) Hi I would like to share some feedback with you regarding the new change about using Thermal Bags to pick-up deliveries from Wolt Market (Grocery items). In my experience this has not been a very welcoming change. Please see my concerns below: 1. Thermal bags are not that strong. When we put grocery items in them, the thermal bag gets damaged/ripped/torn just in a few days as it happened to me. 2. When partners get bundle deliveries, it is not possible to put all paper bags in thermal bags. On the average partners get at least 4 paper bags at least in two bundle deliveries. It is also not possible and practical for the partners to differentiate which item is perishable and which is not in many bags. 3. Similarly, carrying half the order in the thermal bag and half the order in just a paper bag makes it very impractical. 4. In my opinion thermal bags are meant to put restaurant food in them. If we put raw food, for example, mince, chicken or meat, my worry is that Fødevarestyrelsen would have serious objection to that and can impose a fine to the partners if inspected because cooked and uncooked meat should not be kept in the same thermal bag to avoid cross contamination. I just wanted to bring this to your attention and share my real life experience from the past 4 days of trying this out.. Personally, I'm hoping that we revert back to the old system of using paper bags for Wolt Market and thermal bags from everything else. Thank you Abdur Rahim Sajid Medarbejdernr.: 792404 CPR-nr.: 1003633043\", \"If you can't ask MENU not to pack milk/milk cartons (and other cartons or packaging with sharp edges) in paper bags, at least not with a lot of other heavy items, as the edges of the milk cartons cut holes in the paper bags when lifting the bags and the contents move and put pressure on the sides. Pack it so that the bags cannot go and do not overfill the bags. Rather use a bag more or a plastic bag more, please!\"]"

         "[\"Very long wait for McDonald's even if the order was ready.\", 'Hi! Today started great but the few times I’ve run into issues it’s always been at McDonald’s, which I would like to address in this message, because it affects not only me but other couriers and customers also. First of all I always respect each vendors’ instructions such as always bringing my bag into the venue etc. and if you look at McDonald’s instructions it says: 1. Show the order on your phone to the staff 2. Swipe order as picked-up 3. Get the bag with the food Sometimes they get angry if you don’t follow this but I don’t think it makes sense why only McDonald’s have these special instructions when no other vendor does? Today when I walked in the order #980 was already at -27 minutes and I showed it to the staff, at 13.16 I swiped right according to the instructions because I thought it was ready and did the same thing with the other two tasks #985 and #986, which were handed to me immediately but upon further waiting the staff told me that #980 had been “lost in their system” and that they would need to remake it and it would be done in “maybe 15 minutes” and that I should write to Wolt to remove the order. At 13.27 I write to Wolt to explain the situation asking if I should wait or remove. Wolt support asked me to wait for pickup. So I waited a little longer and then asked the staff whether I should wait for the order but he simply told me “We are very busy, somebody else will pick up that order” so at 13.34 I write to support again and ask for a removal even though I wanted to wait for pickup. At 13.40 wolt support removed the order and I leave McDonald’s after almost 30 minutes of being there to continue my deliveries. Then at 14.11, almost one hour after I first received order #980, I get the exact same order #980 from McDonald’s to the same customer, and pick it up. Of course I wondered why nobody else had picked it up earlier but maybe it wasn’t ready until I came, I don’t know, but when I arrived to the customer I saw she was very upset, which is understandable so after giving her the food I tried to explain kindly that McDonalds had to make the order twice but it didn’t help she just slammed the door before I could finish my sentence. We are all human and make mistakes but in this case McDonalds had 27 minutes to take care of this “lost order” either by contacting Wolt directly or informing me as a courier before swiping. I learned my lesson and will never again swipe unless the order is given to me, no matter how angry staff gets because I don’t want to go through this kind of inconvenience I went through today because it feels really bad for me to contact Wolt support about issues such as these. Wolt support was of course amazing and kind towards me but I hope that McDonald’s will change these special instructions and that someone will think of an idea to make the pick-up experience at McDonalds as smooth and as professional as in other venues. Thank you for taking your time to read this! David', \"I had an unacceptable experience at McDonald's, i arrive and the order should've been ready 5 minutes ago, i wait at the Wolt pickup line for about 10 minutes, before I get impatient and say excuse me before I ask for someone if my order is being prepared. Then they start preparing the order now, and i have to wait a further 5 minutes before i receive my order i have to deliver. I don't get an apology or anything. I know they're doing their work as 'well' as they now can, but it's also respectless to hold me up on my work, especially because I'm not paid by the hour but per delivery, and the amount of time it takes is irrelevant, so I got paid a total of 37.5 DKK for an order that took me about 30 minutes because i had to wait at McDonald's for 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable for me and I would like to be either reimbursed, or put on deny list from taking orders from McDonald's as this is the second time out of 2 times i have picked up from McDonald's and I had to wait more than 20 minutes. I would like to be taken off McDonald's because I'm currently doing single deliveries but plan to combined deliveries at some point, where I cannot reject and order from a resturant. Therefore i would like to NOT receive orders from McDonald's or be reimbursed everytime I have to wait more than 10 minutes at any McDonald's as I'm currently earning HALF of minimum wage from that pickup.\"]"
